      "contents": "Hello everyone! Sorry for the lack of updates lately. I've been very brain-foggy, so progress has been slow, but I've got a good number of goodies for you today!\n\nFirst, we now have native OpenLipSync library integration for viseme analysis! This library has been created by our own community member @kyuubiyoru and is a great alternative to the proprietary OVRLipSync. If you're on Windows, you can choose either to run analysis and on Linux it'll automatically use this one, fixing the issue where viseme analysis doesn't work for Linux users! Check the repo as well if you'd like to contribute - we'll update this library as it improves!\n\n[previewyoutube=oSVugEX_4ng;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nMost of other stuff is general splittening cleanup. For our business usecases, there's a mechanism where the taskbar icon (and splash screen) can now be updated dynamically for whitelabeled universe - but there's some small treats for you too - it'll show your profile picture as overlay when you're logged in and the record syncing is now shown on taskbar too!\n\nOne of the big(ish) sources of renderer crashing is also fixed now and yt-dlp should now properly auto-update as well!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Natively integrate OpenLipSync library as alternative analyzer for VisemeAnalyzer (based on issue @kyuubiyoru, @grayboltwolf, @reddneko, DarkRTA, @baplar, Naia-love, Orion, @toasteruwu, @stellanora, library by @kyuubiyoru, integrated by @frooxius, NuGet CI/CD implemented by @j4.lc)\n-- Huge thanks to @kyuubiyoru for making this library!\n-- If you'd like to check it out or contribute, check this repo: https://github.com/KyuubiYoru/OpenLipSync\n-- VisemeAnalyzer now has \"PreferredAnalyzer\" field that allows selecting active analyzer\n-- When OVRLipSync is not available (e.g. Linux) the system automatically falls back to OpenLipSync - this fixes visemes not working for Linux users\n\n- Added mechanisms to override renderer icon & splash screen over IPC mechanism to allow for custom branding for private universes and business use-cases\n- Record syncing progress now shows up on the taskbar icon in Windows\n-- This is a small addition possible thanks to the update above!\n- Resonite will now show an overlay icon on the taskbar with the profile picture of the currently logged in user\n-- This will be later expanded to show things like unread messages\n\n- Added ComparisonMode to ReplaceSubstring & Replace FirstSubstring nodes (based on feedback by @jackthefoxotter, issue #4901)\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Switched half datatype implementation to native .NET datatype from an explicit implementation (issue #5180 by @yoshiyoshiyoshiyoshiyoshyoshyosh)\n-- This has better performance and more stable conversions between half <--> float\n-- Added missing methods to encode the datatype in the data model, preventing exceptions when saving elements with this type\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed renderer crash due to off-by-one error when updating materials and the number of elements exactly aligns with the end of current update buffer (based on report by @thejebforge, @dustysprinkles, @celeste_heartsong, @laizze, @uruloke, @coggy9, @salira_daxius, issue #5482)\n- Fixed TubeSpiralMesh not being correctly adapted for legacy content (reported by @stellanora, @rucio, issue #5466)\n-- TubeSpiralMesh now has \"RadiusIndependentStepScaling\" property - when turned on, the number of steps is computed as if the spiral had unit radius, rather than scaled by the actual radius (this is also used to preserve the legacy behavior)\n- Fixed yt-dlp update not working correctly (based on reports by @epiceaston197 , @draconas_rayne, @_deltawolf, @troyborg, @krzeszny, @reddneko, @grand__, @foolishsnowmew, @luxkitty, SlyTheFloof, @karasutengu, @stellanora, @foxbox., issue #2518)\n-- The update is also only attempted once per session\n- Fixed desktop mirror freezing when the renderer gets decoupled (reported by @reddneko, issue #5560)",

I wasn't originally planning on pushing a build today since it's Friday, but there's a few important changes for upcoming events and security fix, as well as few improvements from other team members that got merged in!\n\nCompatible with previous! Will have more next week!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added sendFriendRequest and removeFriend commands to the Headless Server Software (requested by @amasteramaster, issue #4762, implemented by @j4.lc)\n-- This allows you to manage the headless contacts list without having to log into the client\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- Saving worlds or changing their public status will now not auto-process any linked worlds unless the record link specifically indicates that the world needs to be linked (requested by @JackTheFoxOtter, issue #5577)\n-- To mark a world as linked, add ?linked=true at the end of its resrec:/// URL\n-- This prevents worlds accidentally being marked as public due to references to them saved in other worlds and being saved to another account when saving the root world (e.g. through world orbs or screenshots, reported by @.missmolly, @daveheiser, @GearBell, @reddneko, @Baplar, @JackTheFoxOtter, @Nytra, @kulza, @knackrack, davidheiserca, issue #5573\n-- IMPORTANT: This is BREAKING change due to security considerations, where most worlds shouldn't be processed as linked to avoid leaking them. However if you were relying on this behavior with a world structure where you embed worlds into another and need them to be saved together, you will need to update the URL's to indicate explicit linking\n-- Note: This doesn't affect saving worlds stored locally to cloud - if you have references to local worlds in a root local world that you then save to the cloud, those embedded local worlds will also be recursively saved to the cloud - this is because cloud cannot reference worlds stored on local machine\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Added events.resonite.com and discord.com to the default trusted hosts (implemented by @Gawdl3y)\n-- events.resonite.com is used for the official community events facet\n-- discord.com is in addition to the already-existing discordapp.net since the API is typically used at discord.com now\n- Updated the included yt-dlp vinaries to nightly 2025.09.11.232836 (implemented by @Gawdl3y)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged English locale fix by @muppeq \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged French locale update by @baplar \n- Merged Russian locale update by AntonBoch1244 and @shizzo1d \n- Merged Esperanto locale update by @sejden \n- Merged Swedish locale update by @fuzzybipolarbear and @dwaggiemorph \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Chinese (Taiwan) locale update by @meowwei \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Typed Dynamic Impulse trigger commands on the Headless Server Software now correctly display the count number of impulses triggered (reported by @reddneko, issue #4717, fixed by @j4.lc)\n- Fixed a bug where when a groups name was changed the old name would still be displayed in some areas (reported by @jackthefoxotter, @dantetucker, issue #4885, fixed by @dantetucker)\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I got a new build for you (possibly the only one this week since I'll be at EF) with a bunch of goodies!\n\nThe renderer decoupling is now implemented! This triggers only on large hitches by default (and during startup) to smooth out some of the lagspikes. While it will cause everything in the scene to freeze (except videos!), you will still have head tracking, which makes those hitches feel nicer whenever they happen and prevents interrupting video watching.\n\nYou can also force the engine and renderer to always be decoupled, essentially running asynchronously, but I only recommend this for diagnostic purposes (like checking if you're CPU or GPU bound) - it will be pretty stuttery in a lot of cases!\n\nThere's some smaller low hanging fruit optimizations as well and some bugfixes.\n\nThere's also a whole bunch of contributions from the team too! Updated World Light Sources Wizard, Active checkboxes in the inspector, updated badges and asset variant stability improvements!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Implemented renderer auto-decoupling and re-rendering previous scene state on hitches (issue #4747)\n-- Whenever FrooxEngine hitches (by default for more than ~66 ms) the renderere will start rendering previous scene state independently\n-- In VR, this allows head tracking to continue to work in such cases, only freezing the scene state rather than entire rendering and allows video playback to continue, reducing interruptions during such hitches\n-- You can configure this mechanism in Settings -> Graphics -> Renderer Decoupling\n-- You can adjust at what immediate framerate it triggers and how many frames it takes to re-engage the lockstep\n-- You can optionally force the renderer to always be decoupled and run asynchronously. However this is mostly meant for diagnostic purposes - e.g. determining if you're CPU or GPU bound and will likely cause significant stutters in motion\n\n- Added detailed diagnostics for issue #5482 by @thejebforge, @karasutengu, @dustysprinkles\n\n- Added Set/Multiply Intensity and Set/Multiply Range to the World Light Sources Wizard (requested by @modernballoonie, issue #4684, implemented by @ryuvi)\n-- These operators replace the old Change Intensity/Range, providing clearer info on what you're doing with those fields on the lights you're editing\n\n- Added new yearly badges and updated existing ones (based on issue by @aegis_wolf, issue #5289, implemented by @aegis_wolf and @ryuvi)\n-- Yearly badges have been added for 2021, 2022 and 2023.\n-- The badges for 2018, 2019, and 2020 have been updated as well to match the new style for the yearly badges.\n-- In addition to the yearly badges, the potato badge has been updated, and so have the fruit badges.\n\n\n- Added a quick toggle checkbox for every slot's Active property to the inspector hierarchy (requested by @Krzeszny, issue #4940, implemented by @Gawdl3y)\n- Added the ability to grab & drop Slot references onto bool reference receivers/fields to insert a reference to the Slot's Active property (requested by @Cameron5, issue #4641, implemented by @Gawdl3y)\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Optimized submission of data to renderer by reinterpreting memory as Unity types on Unity end, rather than converting them explicitly (issue #4766)\n-- This reduces some wasted CPU cycles, particularly when updating a lot of things (e.g. lots of moved transforms)\n- Skip processing & allocating renderable updates for subsystems that currently don't have any updates to submit (issue #4754)\n- Smoothed out startup experience, by not engaging the frame-locking mechanism until the engine is rendering (issue #4756)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Change default FOV to 75 from 60\n-- This only affects new users, if you already have initialized settings it will remain the same\n- Auto AFK kick will not invalidate invites any more (issue #3005, implemented by @j4.lc)\n- Added a new sound effect for receiving invite requests (requested by @zangooseoo, issue #3798, created by @LacyDoes, implemented by @Gawdl3y)\n- Added a badge for attendees of VR Japan Meeting of Furries 2025\n-- The badges still need to be assigned to users, they are now included in the build\n\n- Inspector hierarchy expand/collapse buttons now require lock in to press to prevent accidental presses (implemented by @Gawdl3y)\n-- This also applies to the new active checkboxes\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged English locale tweak by @muppeq \n- Merged Chinese (Taiwan) locale update by @meowwei \n- Merged Chinese (Mainland) locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Ensure that Awwdio gets properly disposed on shutdown to prevent it from causing shutdown sequence to hang\n- Fixed crash when changing reflection probe type (reported by @reddneko, magenta76, @troyborg, issue #5453)\n- Prevented Asset Workers from crashing when handling invalid Shader files (implemented by @probableprime)\n- Enable Asset processing to handle R8 Formatted Images. This fixes a common Asset Worker failure (implemented by @probableprime)\n- Fixed inconsistent vertical spacing in inspector hierarchy (implemented by @Gawdl3y)\n- Fixed duplicating a slot with the same slot reference used as both the template and overridden parent crashing the game (reported by @JackTheFoxOtter, @mint_shock, fixed by @Gawdl3y, issue #3950)\n",

(reported by @spexcat, @vrbat, dragos240, issue #5311, fixed by @bluecyro)\n-- This majorly affects Linux users, but should also fix the streaming panel for Windows users who were also using the SDL3 audio backend\n- Fixed crashing when VertexColorInterpolationSpace is set to unsupported values on materials (based on report by @ultrawidegamer, @cloud_jumper, issue #5408)\n-- Any unsupported color profile will fallback to Linear\n- Reworked part of renderable asset deallocation mechanism to delay deallocating native resources a few frames after freeing Unity side ones\n-- This should potentially help a number renderer crashes\n-- E.g. this could fix reloading all textures in a heavy world causing a crash (reported by @modernballoonie, @knah, MHowser, issue #5057\n-- This could help with frequent crashes on some machines (reported by @jackthefoxotter, mayedlootah, issue #5415)\n-- Possibly could also help with other crashes (reported by @dustysprinkles, Zahashi, @baplar, issue #5316)\n",

      "contents": "[p]It's here! The biggest and most technically complex update we've done to date - we ripped FrooxEngine out of Unity and let it run under modern .NET 9 runtime, bringing with it massively improved framerate, significantly less hitching (with many straight up gone!) and drastically improved startup & loading times.\n\nBased on the survey we did a while back, it was clear the performance was our #1 problem. You wanted us to improve the performance and this is the update that builds upon all the foundational work - the type system, PhotonDust (our own particle system) and Awwdio (our own audio system) and frees our engine from the shackles of Unity's slow Mono runtime, giving everyone much smoother and snappier experience.\n\nAnd that's not all! We have a brand new Help Tab in the dash, which should help new users especially get more familiar with Resonite. A number of big issues were fixed too, like a number of problems with the reflection probes!\n\n[h1]Is this the end of performance updates?[/h1]\nSwitch to .NET 9 is not the end - it's the beginning of new phase for FrooxEngine! With a modern runtime, we'll be able to implement a number of additional optimizations that we were previously not able to. You'll see some additional improvements in the upcoming weeks as we polish things.\n\nThere are also many bigger optimizations we will do in the future - data model rework, more multi-threading, variable rate updates and more - we are nowhere near the performance ceiling for Resonite. However we will focus on some other things for a bit before that - some other things need some love first.\n\n[h1]Does this mean we're no longer using Unity?[/h1]\nNot yet, but this brings us closer. By separating FrooxEngine outside of Unity, we have much better defined boundary between the two - so much so, that some community members already have partially functional alternative renderers!\n\nSince we're pretty much using Unity mostly for rendering, we plan to replace it completely with a better renderer in the future too - we'll have more on this soon(ish) and we might need your help.\n\n[h1]This update is thanks to your support[/h1]\nThis update has been a big and long journey - the hardest and most complex we've ever undertaken - and probably one of the most unique ones from technological aspect. Inspired by web browser's multi-process architecture, we might be the first game(engine) to employ this type of architecture - most certainly the first Social VR sandbox to do so.\n\nNot only that - we've achieved this with a fraction of resources and funding that other projects have and majority of that came from you, our community and supporters. For that, we owe you a huge thank you. Your support is what keeps us independent and focused on issues that are most important to you.\n\nSince this is a major update, we're including the names of everyone who's been supporting us - your names will be forever part of this big update.\n\nIf you'd like us to keep going and make more updates like this, please consider becoming a supporter too and getting your friends to support us too. We're a small team and we need your help to keep going. Not only will your name be part of future big updates, you'll get a number of perks in-game too!\n\n[h2]Resonite Sponsors[/h2]\n[h3]SiderealScout, Hikari Akimori, Xekri, Earthmark[/h3]\n\n[h3]Large supporters[/h3]\nBigRedWolfy, VRxist, brodokk, ChevronSeven, bd_, JackTheFoxOtter, Skielsthear, Rixx, Meteion, Ikani, Lexevo, StiefelJackal, holmebrian, badhaloninja, MIRA_sk, Tacusin, vizi, Micro, ARandomMeatball, KierDran, MkE, Xyphurr, Keith, rhenium, Zyzyl, Water, Faeith, LotusGaming, TomTom20\n\n(for the rest of supporters, see bottom of this post!)\n\n[h2]Pre-release testers[/h2]\nAnd last, but not least - huge thanks to everyone who participated in pre-release testing! We've likely had the biggest engagement with a pre-release to date and it's thanks to these people that we've been able to chew through issues and stability problems as fast as we could and make the build as stable as it can be for release.\n\nVenport, jvyden, epicEaston197, Modern, Kulza, Kav, kaestral, Kresny, bd_, hantabaru1014, Halo, Zyro, Cloud_Jumper, fulgens, Nytra, Purpzie, orange, Jack, bredo, Foohy, ginjake, Zozokasu, ohzee, KarasuTengu, troyBORG, Redd, e1ght3, Colin, Gawdl3y, UltrawideGamer, navy3001, Snuhr, Cyro!, Kyu, AlphaNeon, Luki, Raidriar🐧, Fin, S-573, FoxoBread, Baplar, Phil, Cyro, Flame, Foolish, Stella, Psychpsyo, Ace, Moonbase__, Dante, Draconas, Udyne, Xau, Aegis_Wolf, tabby, kazu0617, Decoy, Noble, Nexulan, qualia, Wolpy, socksthefennec, harumaki021, Nuki, SlyTheFloof, Sylva, Alex, Jae, mpmxyz, Noel, Kyuubi, Nulhomme, Tobs, 🦝GoldyRaccoony🦝, hare_ware, Axеl, TheJebForge, Pariah, Syon_, ProbablePrime, Ryuvi, RueShejn, Zyzyl, Bionite, Lexie, 989onan, Tulip, jonnyawsom3, Toni, Lux, GONT_3, shininghero, Tekno, Grand, Zenuru, Banane9, Readun, Pyroboy, Charizmare, Muppeq, wolf_seisenbacher, TheBlackParrot, Alex_2Pi, Foxbox, Defhammer, yosh, Shadow, Canadian_RedZ, Kawwabi, Papaltine, SylviaAnim8or, Hikari, Sejden, MirPASEC, Fuzzy and more! (I apologize if you're not included, these are auto-generated from all the changelogs!)\n\n[h1]Can I test & compare previous builds?[/h1]\nSince this is the biggest update we've done, if you need/want to use the previous builds, we've made two new branches on Steam: `pre-splittening` and `pre-splittening-headless`. Those contain current release and headless builds (password is same as normal headless branch).\n\nYou can use these for benchmarking & comparisons for the immediate future, but they **will not be maintained**.\n\nWe also strongly recommend using separate database for these with `-Data <path>` and `-NeverSaveDash` arguments, as the database between the two is slightly incompatible.\n\n[h1]What comes next?[/h1]\nAs with every big release, there will likely pop up a number of issues with this - plus we have some still left over from the testing. We'll work on sorting those out as fast as we can to stabilize things.\n\nWe also have a number of additional improvements coming up too, which should squeeze out a little more performance out of this update and add additional features - like ability for the renderer to reboot on crash, without crashing the whole engine! You can find more here: <https://github.com/orgs/Yellow-Dog-Man/projects/50>\n\nOnce we're done with the post-release polish, we'll transition into other smaller tasks and then the next big project - which is yet to be decided!\n\n[h1]Changelog[/h1]\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Reworked engine to use a multi-process architecture, allowing to run FrooxEngine outside of Unity with modern .NET 9 runtime (which has significantly better JIT codegen & significantly better garbage collector) (requested by pretty much @everyone, issue #706 and #2429, implemented by me (@frooxius) with contributions from @bluecyro, @gawdl3y, @j4.lc and @probableprime)\n-- This massively improves overall framerate\n-- This also removes large amount of hitches and significantly reduces others\n-- The new architecture also significantly improves asset loading performance, drastically improving load times\n-- Startup time has been drastically improved\n-- HTTP 2/3 is now supported for API & asset downloads thanks to .NET 9, with default concurrent downloads being increased to 100\n-- Linux now uses hybrid Linux-native .NET 9 architecture with only renderer under Proton for improved performance\n-- Generally everything across the board is just faster now, some things more some things less, some HW will experience more, some HW less, but overall should be noticeable improvements!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added Help Screen to the dashboard to provide easy to access information about how to use Resonite (issue #1123, implemented by @aegis_wolf, @ryuvi, @rueshejn)\n\n- Added TryEnumToInt<E> & TryIntToEnum<E> nodes which can convert any integer type to/from enum with graceful fallback\n-- These nodes can be used to convert integer types that do not match the backing type of the enum\n-- When the value is out of range a fallback value is outputted\n-- TryIntToEnum has optional OnlyDefined - when true, any integer values that do not map to enum values will also fail, even if they're in range\n-- Old instances of EnumToInt/IntToEnum nodes are converted to these to fix breakage due to enum changes (reported by @.fulgens, @axel_el_gato, issue #5153)\n- Added ReflectionProbeMetadata which provides statistics about the probe (currently number of times the probe has rendered in OnChanges mode)\n-- This info is also displayed in the inspector under the ReflectionProbe\n-  Added native support for BGR565 textures with DX11\n-- RGB565 textures will automatically fallback/convert to BGR565 on DX11\n\n- Added \"studioNameLong\" and \"studioNameShort\" as global localization attributes that can be used in any string (requested by @rueshejn, implemented by @probableprime)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Made OnUnitCircle, InsideUnitCircle and OnUnitSphere random distributions uniform (based on issue by @yoshiyoshiyoshiyoshiyoshyoshyosh, brecert, @ohzee, issue #4142)\n\n**Locale:**\n- Merged English locale updates by @modernballoonie, @zyro1331, @muppeq \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Chinese (Taiwan) locale update by @meowwei, msparkles\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Esperanto locale update by @sejden \n- Merged Russian locale update by @troyborg \n- Merged German locale update by @cameron5 \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged French locale update by @baplar \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @kazu0617, @ginjake, @zozokasu\n- Merged Swedish locale update by @fuzzybipolarbear \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- A number of issues related to the generation of reflection probes have been resolved (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Client-Side Asset Variant Generation is now correctly thread limited based on your computer's CPU. It was previously unbounded particularly in Block Compression which is used for Reflection Probes.\n-- Reduced the quality of BC6H & BC7 image compression in Asset Variant Pipelines from 0.6 to 0.25, this results in up to 50% reductions in the time it takes to compute these assets. All with no perceivable difference in visual clarity of those assets.\n-- These were all found/reported in Baking reflection probes causes my game to freeze horribly and take almost 4 minutes to bake

@rueshejn, SkywindKitsune, VirgilCore, @airride91, @ultrawidegamer, @rockstarraccoon and @.fulgens issue #1983\n\n- Fixed continuously colored/sized particle trails incorrectly initializing the initial point of the trail\n- Fixed stuck ProtoFlux breaking logic not working correctly, resulting in infinite freeze (based on report by @jvyden4, @colin.cat, issue #4878)\n- Fixed race conditions during initialization causing inconsistencies for encoding/decoding dependency types, causing some users to be unable to join certain sessions\n-- This would affect sessions with certain datatypes, notably RefToOutput node (reported by @kulza, issue #5237 and cfin2222, @pyroboy, @nytra, @jackthefoxotter, @ultrawidegamer, issue #4408)\n- Fixed crash when user connected over TCP disconnects\n\n[h2]Known issues:[/h2]\n- Clipboard on Linux only supports Text, but not images & files yet\n-- Files can be drag & dropped onto the window\n-- You can import a single file by copying its path (on GNOME copying a single file should work for this too)\n[/p]\n\n[h1]Resonite supporters who made this possible[/h1]\n(see higher in this post for list of sponsors and very large

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I've been very busy with the splittening work, however there's a few good updates that have accumulated in the meanwhile - most of them from rest of the team!\n\nThis build also features @j4.lc's first build contribution! :D\n\nThere's a mix of new features, tweaks, security fixes and some more pride badges contributed by the community!\n\nNow I go back to the splittening! x3 (funnily enough, it's harder for me to make new builds, I had to use my laptop since I still had the previous environment - the splittneing changes things drastically how the build is structured).\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added `version` command to the headless (requested in issue #2021, implemented by @j4.lc)\n-- This simply prints out the current version number\n- Value/ReferenceUserOverride now have \"ClearOnUserLeave\" option which will remove the override when the user leaves (requested by @jackthefoxotter, issue #1013, implemented by @bluecyro)\n- Added \"Direct Cursor Enabled\" setting which disables the ghost/direct cursor (based on feedback by @dustysprinkles, issue #3654, implemented by @probableprime)\n\n- Added \"Multiplicative\" sampling mode to numeric spatial variable samplers (issue #4580, implemented by @ryuvi)\n-- This sampling mode lets you multiply all currently-read spatial variables together\n-- Please note that the Default Value on the sampler has to be non-zero, otherwise you will only ever read zero - since any value multiplied by zero is zero\n\n- yt-dlp will now auto-update to latest release on the nightly branch (requested by @epiceaston197, @reddneko, @grand__, @luxkitty, @foxbox and others, issue #2518)\n-- Big thanks to bashonly for providing us with detailed overview of their organizational & review process/structure!\n-- This should prevent frequent video breakages and ensure best compatibility with streaming services\n\n- Added StraightAlly pride badge (contributed by brecert)\n- Added Transmasculine & Transfeminine pride badge (contributed by @epiceaston197)\n- Added Aegosexual pride badge (contributed by brecert)\n- Added Aroace pride badge (contributed by @epiceaston197)\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- Removed legacy TranscientGrabbable component which could dump its contents to Userspace and posed security risk (reported by @nytra via security ticket, fixed by @probableprime)\n-- This component was replaced by \"TransferGrabbable\" quite awhile ago, but we had not removed the old system.\n- Fixed a world crash that occured when an audio clip player component is deleted on the standard Resonite Audio Player (reported in Security Ticket #551749 by @fluffysnowkitty, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Limit source infrastructures for migration to known ones to avoid abuse (based on security ticket by @knackrack, @art0007i)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Removed beta notice for Stripe subcriptions on the Account website (implemented by @gawdl3y)\n-- Stripe is now considered stable and out of beta!\n- Made several other minor improvements to the account website (implemented by @gawdl3y)\n-- We're planning on completely reworking this in the near future\n\n- Allowed headless-es and automatic startup worlds to be loaded from World Orb records instead of un-gracefully failing (reported by @bwgi, issue #3853, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Also prevents headless-es and automatic startup worlds from attempting to load anything that is not a world orb or a world. This produces a more graceful error message.\n\n- Whisper bubble will ignore all audio effects by default (based on report by @kulza, @rucio, issue #4601)\n-- You can re-enable it on your AvatarAudioOutputManager if you really want it\n\n- Added \"Remember Me\" to Registration dialog page (based on feedback by @_deltawolf, @aritosuits, issue #4053)\n-- This way new user registrations will auto-login next time when the option is checked\n\n- Added additional diagnostics for Omnicept driver (to help issue by @derpicidal, issue #4446)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Esperanto locale update by @sejden \n- Merged Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan) locale update by medicalwei, @lavenderfox0w0\n- Merged Chinese (Simplified) locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc\n- Merged global locale fix for incompatible session key by @_deltawolf (issue #4558)\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Further adjusted Direct Cursor Sizing to mitigate it flickering at a very large size in some cases (reported by @dustysprinkles, issue #3654, fixed by @probableprime)",

This is mostly a \"cleanup\" build, fixing up some stuff with Awwdio, giving you more control over voice reverb, merging in some cool additions by @gawdl3y and updates to the pride badges (including adding Graysexual flag) thanks to community contributions by brecert!\n\nI've already been transitioning to work on the splittening, but I wanted to polish up a few more things that popped up (fun note a bunch of this build stuff was made on my train ride home x3)!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added \"IgnoreAudioEffects\" to \"VoiceModeConfig\" (present on AvatarAudioConfiguration & AvatarAudioOutputManager) (requested by @nexulan, @kulza, issue #4320 and related to issue by @epiceaston197, mxjessie, @.fulgens, @kulza, @jackthefoxotter, issue #4289)\n-- This allow configuring voice modes to ignore voice effects per-avatar & per-world (e.g. if your reverb zones are not designed to work with voices, you can use this to have users ignore them)\n-- Worlds saved before Awwdio will have AvatarAudioConfiguration injected and configured to ignroe audio effects on CommnonAvatarBuilder to preserve legacy behavior for those worlds. If you saved your world since, you'll need to do this manually.\n\n- Added \"Force audio effects off for voices\" setting under Audio - Audio Accessibility Settings (requested by @epiceaston197, mxjessie, @reddneko, @.fulgens, @kulza, @jackthefoxotter, issue #4289)\n-- Turning this on will disable effects (e.g. reverb) on user voices\n-- This is meant to help people with hearing or audio processing issues, where effects make voices hard to understand\n\n- Added \"AllowLocallyIgnoringAudioEffects\" to VoiceModeConfig\n-- When disabled, the effects will always be applied regardless of the setting\n-- This is meant for worlds where the effects are needed for gameplay reasons\n-- Please do not turn this off unless your world really needs it to improve the world's accessibility\n\n- Added hands near/far FOV settings for quick photo capture (requested by @ohzee, @drfrankreal, issue #4448, implemented by @gawdl3y)\n\n- Added Graysexual pride badge (requested by @ultrawidegamer, @reddneko, issue #4542, graphic icon provided by brecert)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Merged pride badge tweaks by brecert\n-- This fixes color leaking around edges and between stripes\n-- It fixes padding on some badges\n-- It fixes wrong color on Polyamory flag heart\n\n- Values & References can now be dropped on the member buttons in the inspector, instead of just the label (requested by @art0007i, issue #4313, implemented by @gawdl3y)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq\n- Merged English locale fix by @muppeq\n- Merged Taiwanese Mandarin locale update by @meowwei\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed exception spam with Unity Native video playback for videos that have no audio tracks (reported by @.fulgens, issue #4518)",

Once we have better UI for managing your account, we'll make it fancier to manage all your badges!\n\nNot only that, we made the graphics of the initial set (created by @chromashiba) open under CC0 - we want people to use them!\n\nThis build is compatible with previous, but if you don't update the new badges won't show on users who join your worlds.\n\nWe've got some bugfixes coming soon(ish) too, but we wanted to get these out of the door early.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added official pride flag badges\n-- You can assign/remove them from you by sending `/addpridebadge <name>` or `/removepridebadge <pride flag name>` command to the Resonite bot - e.g. `/addpridebadge Transgender`. Capitalization doesn't matter.\n-- If you send the command without a pride flag name, it'll list all currently available ones\n-- Once we have account UI we'll provide a better interface for assigning those badges, but this should do for now\n-- We're starting with a set of 24 common pride flags. If you'd like us to add more specific ones make a request on GitHub please!\n-- You can add as many as you want to your profile (note that eventual name badge rework might only display a limited number by default and then rotate through the rest)\n-- The current set of flags is based on <https://www.hrc.org/resources/lgbtq-pride-flags> as a reference\n-- Flag badge images were created by @chromashiba\n-- We made the badge icons repository CC0 if you want to use them in your own project! https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/PrideFlags\n-- These badges are permanent addition to Resonite - they'll stay after Pride month ends! \n-- Current available badges (as of this build) are: `Agender, Asexual, Bigender, Bisexual, Demigender, Demisexual, Genderfluid, Genderqueer, GilbertBaker, Intersex, IntersexProgress, Lesbian, Nonbinary, Pansexual, Philadelphia, Polyamory, Polysexual, Progress, Queer, QueerPeopleOfColor, Traditional, TransGender, TransInclusiveGayMen, TwoSpirit`",

This replaces the older mechanism with one where we generate all the GPU data on FrooxEngine side and upload it through low level API's - this completely changes how meshes are pushed into the GPU.\n\nWith latest prerelease it seems that things are working pretty well and there's no remaining issues that I'd consider blockers for this. \n\nIt's not only an important part of the splittening (with the major push for the split now being the next part), but should help with performance right now too!\n\nNotably large mesh uploads are now split over multiple frames, so they should not hitch as much. There are still going to be other sources of hitches, but this should help some!\n\nBig thanks to everyone who helped us test and catch bugs in prerelease: @epiceaston197, @zyro1331, @luxkitty, @lecloutpanda, @euphieeuphoria, @ohzee, @rabbuttz, @epsilion.cat, @kazu0617, @nytra, @bredo, CheesecakeCG, @dustysprinkles, @jackthefoxotter, @jvyden4, @bluetera, alexderpyfox, @j4.lc, @modernballoonie, @karasutengu, @kyuvulpes, @jasonmo \n\nIf any more issues pop up, please still make reports, we'll get them cleaned up in subsequent builds.\n\nThere are other things too like the GrabbableSaveBlock component! This lets you prevent items from being saved for gameplay purposes - it's NOT a security feature! Read the description for it to learn more please.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added GrabbableSaveBlock (requested by @jackthefoxotter issue #2950, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- When added to a slot, it will block the ability to save items that are grabbed through context menu, inventory browser or contact window\n-- This features is **NOT** permission system feature and is not designed to provide security or prevent asset theft\n-- It is designed for gameplay mechanics/items when you want to control how an item is saved. As an example, you might add the component to all the cards within a deck of playing cards, but you would not add it to the box. This would prevent you from saving individual cards, encouraging you to remember to save the box.\n\n- Added byte, sbyte, short & ushort vector types to the core engine\n-- These are currently mostly used for internal operations and low level byte data wrangling\n\n- Added \"Reset bones to bind poses\" to SkinnedMeshRenderer\n-- This will reset the bone poses to their bind pose of the current mesh\n-- The bones must not be driven for this to work\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Reworked GPU mesh upload mechanism to use signular buffer & low level API (as part of the spilttening, issue #2429)\n-- FrooxEngine is now responsible for generating mesh buffers for the GPU, allowing more control over the process & skipping duplicated validations and checks on Unity side\n-- This speeds up the mesh uploads, improving latency for dynamic meshes in a number of cases\n-- Large uploads are now spread over multiple frames, reducing hitches when loading heavy meshes (like avatars with lots of blendshapes). Note that this means the meshes might take longer to load, as a tradeoff for a hitch, but this is expected to be improved once the split happens\n-- Skinned mesh bounds update method has been moved from Unity side to FrooxEngine side as well and includes a custom algorithm for static bounds computation\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed all string constant nodes having invisible names (reported by @art0007i, issue #177, fixed by @probableprime)\n\n\n",

Next on the list is reworking the mesh data upload, which might actually provide some performance benefits (reducing some hitches and such) - but we'll see how that goes, that'll probably be next week thing (though part of it is already implemented).\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added \"Avatars\" world category to make it easier to find avatar worlds (requested by @aegis_wolf, @rueshejn, @ryuvi, @chromashiba, @ariel_emerald, issue #3809)\n-- This will list any worlds that have \"avatar\" in one of the tags\n-- The worlds are sorted by popularity by default (based on number of visits)\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- Prevent SimpleAvatarProtection items from being loaded from raw assets without the record (based on report by @scarstrf, ticket #780480)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Added extra diagnostics to starting audio devices (based on report by @chipkemono, issue #4409)\n- Remove forgotten debug logging line when using secondary audio output for the camera (reported by @esnya, issue #4432)\n- Added additional diagnostics for failing to decode component types (based on report by @snow.miser, @ultrawidegamer, issue #4430)\n\n- List editor buttons in the inspector now require lock in to press to prevent accidental pressses (reported by @modernballoonie, issue #2992, implemented by @gawdl3y)\n\n- Migrated a number of Unity-side device drivers fully to FrooxEngine\n-- This is a small part of the splittening, making the upcoming separation easier\n-- While this is mostly maintaining feature parity, some existing issues should be resolved (e.g. Leap Motion not working, issue #8, SRAnipal locking up the game completely in some cases on initialization and so on)\n-- Following drivers were migrated: Leap Motion, Vive Pro Eye (SRAnipal), Windows integration (screenshots, clipboard), bHaptics, OWO Suit, HP Omnicept Eye Tracking\n-- Big thanks to everyone who helped test prerelease: @charizmare, @shininghero, @karasutengu, @climber._, @nytra, MHowser, @luxkitty, @chipkemono, @zozokasu\n\n- Updated Sociable icon (updated by @chromashiba)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Mongolian locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged English locale tweak by @gawdl3y \n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread \n- Merged Finnish locale update by @airride91 \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged German locale update by @nightthefox \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed legacy non-spatialized AudioOutputs being affected by Doppler (reported by @epiceaston197, @baplar and @.fulgens, issue #4399)\n- Fixed User Inspector not populating when spawned by non-host (reported by @baru14, issue #4392, fixed by @dantetucker)\n- Fixed choppy high/low pitched audio when audio device ends up using different sample rate than initialy reported (reported by @chipkemono, issue #4409)\n- Fixed parsing \"?\" as datatype throwing an exception\n-- This fixes Component Attacher breaking after typing \"?\" (reported by @mpmxyz, issue #4396)\n- Fixed InteractiveCamera not assigning correct transform to PhotoMetadata (reported by @baru14, issue #4397)\n",

      "contents": "I've got a new cool Awwdio feature - the interactive camera can now render into a separate audio device, allowing you to stream/record audio from its viewpoint without affecting your own - and have your voice be spatialized! This should make it much easier for streaming and making content on Resonite!\n\nI think need to give it a bit of a tune-up too, because it seems to crackle sometimes - the buffer handling is still assuming it's the main output and doesn't actually give itself enough space, I'll sort that out tomorrow!\n\nThere's some other goodies too, like the OSC fix from @probableprime! And some other bugfixes.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added ability to render interactive camera audio separately on another audio device (requested by me, @dr.sci.cortex, @shdw_x, @mpmxyz, issue #4370)\n-- You can enable this in Audio settings by checking \"Separate Streaming Camera Output\"\n-- You also need to select which audio device will the camera output to - this needs to be different from your main output device\n-- The option \"Audio from camera viewpoint\" must also be enabled - however when the separation is on, it'll be enabled by default on spawn\n-- The camera audio is rendered completely independently from yours - with spatialization, falloff, reverb zones depending on the camera position\n- Added \"Render Own Voice on Camera\" setting (under \"Camera\") category\n-- When the interactive camera audio is separated, this controls whether the camera will hear your own voice or not\n\n- Added ExcludedListeners to AudioOutput\n-- This allows the audio output to not be heard by specific listeners (requested by @marsmaantje, @Elektrospy, issue #4274)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- AvatarAudioOutputManager now uses ExcludedListeners to prevent user from hearing themselves rather than excluded users\n-- This allows other listeners in the scene to render the user's own voice\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Mongolian locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed OSC_Sender breaking after being disabled or having its user changed (reported by @orange3134, issue #2732 and @jackthefoxotter, issue #2769, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed ChannelVolumeMeter skipping part of the audio buffer for computation when there's more than 1 channel, resulting in wrong values (reported by @nytra, issue #4366)\n-  Fixed SampleSpatialVariablePartialDerivative output being twice as big as it's supposed to be (based on report by @yoshiyoshiyoshiyoshiyoshyoshyosh, @bluecyro, issue #4367)\n-- This was due to sampling distance for each point being twice as long. The sampling distance is total distance between the positive and negative point - meaning each point is offset by half from the center\n- Fixed quantity coder initialization, breaking components that use quantity (reported by @mpmxyz, issue #4370)\n\n[h2]Known issues:[/h2]\n- The streaming camera output can crackle due to not having its own buffering handling\n-- This should be fixed tomorrow",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I got a huge update for you! :D \n\nAwwdio is now our in-house audio system, replacing the previous hybrid system with one that's fully our own! Not only does this finish the last major piece needed to be moved fully into FrooxEngine for The Splittening to happen, but it comes with another cool feature - Spatial Variables! A double combo of coolness!\n\nI'll be on a lookout for any issues that pop up and there's few small features I plan to add post-release, but generally... Awwdio is done! Meaning that focus will soon be shifting towards the splittening, so stay tuned!\n\nThe system will automatically convert any existing content to the new system, with some caveats - notably for Reverb Zones - check the notes below for details. If you run into any issues, DO NOT SAVE the content, because that will bake the issues in. We'll be on lookout for problems post release too and we can fixup conversions as long as you have original versions of worlds and objects.\n\nSpatial variables themselves are a huge feature on their own - while relatively simple in principle, they have tons of usecases, from spatially interactive systems, games, culling systems, effect zones and many more! You can watch video on them here if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83cVUv8on5g\n\nHuge thanks to everyone who helped test Awwdio and polish it up for the public release: @anquietas_sys, @bluecyro, @zyro1331, @modernballoonie, @vrbat, @shininghero, @stiefeljackal, @.fulgens, @tobs2007, @foxobread, @dustysprinkles, @ohzee, @bredo, @martysh12, @nytra, @qualium, @gawdl3y, @freyar, @marsmaantje, @989onan, @enziv, @catboy.slim, @epiceaston197, @zenuru, brecert, SylviaAnim8or, @goldenrecord, @grand__, @euphieeuphoria, @badhaloninja, @shdw_x, @lucasro7, @orange3134, @jackthefoxotter, @unskilledwolf, @elektrospy, @art0007i, @yoshiyoshiyoshiyoshiyoshyoshyosh, @karasutengu, @mpmxyz, @pjb, @rabbuttz, @zozokasu and anyone else if I forgot to include you! (poke me and I'll add you to the list).\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n\n[h3]Awwdio - new audio engine[/h3]\nIntroducing a fully custom in-house audio engine - Awwdio! Replacing the previous hybrid system (which was about 80 % our custom audio handling and 20 % Unity's system), this is the last major piece needed for the \"splittening\" - the final phase of the big performance update with switch to .NET 9. It also gives us full control over how audio works in Resonite, fixing a number of issues and opening door for many new faetures in the future.\n\n- Implemented & integrated Awwdio - our in-house audio system (requsted by me, issue #2430)\n-- The system is heavily multi-threaded for high performance, with lock-free concurrent mixing\n-- Spatialization is provided by Steam Audio with direct integration\n-- Default number of audio voices is 64 and can be increased in settings (be careful with very large values as they impact performance and might cause popping)\n-- The default latency is configured to be same as Unity - 1024 buffer for simulation, with 4096 playback buffer\n-- You can lower the latency in Settings. However note that lowering the latency can cause more crackles and RunAfterFinalPoseUpdate\n\n- Added AudioListener component which provides an explicit way to determine where audio is rendered from\n-- It can also be used as a source for audio data for AudioOutput, working as a virtual microphone (This only works on listeners that aren't bound to specific user - ActiveUser must be null)\n-- The listener has a list of effects that are applied to the audio it hears (currently just reverb zones, but there will be more in the future)\n-- By default this list is managed by CloningReferenceSpatialVariableCollector, but this is not necessary - the list can be updated statically too (right now we don't provide mechanism to replace the default template yet)\n\n- Implemented ZitaReverb to replace legacy ReverbZones\n-- ZitaReverb has been integrated by @bluecyro \n-- This is a different implementation so it does sound different, which is expected\n-- Legacy reverb zones are mapped to a preset that's closest to the legacy one (mapping has been implemented by @bluecyro to match the vibe of old presets as much as possible)\n-- This is a stereo reverb effect\n-- Reverb zones now work with spatialized audio sources - including user voices in normal mode!\n\n- Implemented AudioFilterBlendWrapper, which wraps other filters around and provides blending functionality\n-- This is useful for audio reverb zones, allowing each listener with its own blend weight to share the same instance of AudioZitaReverb (and potentially other filters in the future)\n\n- Added \"Preserve Legacy Reverb Zone Handling\" setting (under Music -> Legacy Feature Settings\") (based on request by @bluecyro, issue #4231)\n-- By default this is off - meaning by default all spatialized audio outputs will now be affects by reverb zones (unless they explicitly checked \"IgnoreReverbZones\" setting)\n-- While this is a breaking change, it generally should be a positive one, making existing content and avatars more immersive\n-- By turning this setting on, the legacy behavior will be preserved exactly for any subsequently loaded content - you can re-save the content loaded this way to bake the behavior in\n\n- Added Pitch to AudioOutput, which allows altering the pitch of the output without affecting its length\n-- Note: Altering pitch by altering Speed of the clip player is still preferred method - it's more performant with less artifacts (and better handling for extreme values)\n-- Unlike Speed, this works on any source - even realtime sources like user voices\n-- This uses realtime pitch shift effect, which will have some artifacts - especially the larger the pitch shift is\n-- Pitch shifting algorithm integrated by @bluecyro\n\n- AudioOutput now exposes SpatializationStartDistance and SpatializationTransitionRange\n-- This controls where the spatialization starts and blends from stereo audio to spatialized\n-- It's useful if you want to make the audio go \"broadcast\" when you get near the source\n\n- Implemented auto-audio ducking, that automatically lowers the gain when the signal exceeds 1.0 and then slowly(ish) recovers\n-- This is applied at three levels - individual audio output renders for each listener, listener mixes and final output mix (e.g. combining multiple listeners)\n-- This fixes clipping caused by the binaural effect, which adds gain to the signal (reported by @.fulgens, issue #4127)\n-- This was also requested by @.fulgens, @Zyro1331 in issue #4117 to happen globally\n\n- Added support for 7.1 channel audio buffers\n-- This fixes audio not working with 8 channel headsets (based on report by @dustysprinkles, issue #4079)\n\n[h3]Spatial Variables[/h3]\nComing alongside Awwdio is the spatial variable system, which was added to handle the reverb zones with the new system! This provides a new and easy way to sample values at various points in space and build variety of different systems.\n\n- Implemented Spatial Variables (issue #574, requested by @frooxius (me :3))\n-- This system allows to define values in space and then sample points in space to determine value at that point\n-- Sampling spatial variables is very efficient, using BepuV2 acceleration structure for spatial queries\n-- There's a number of spatial variable shapes and samplers with different behaviors for various use-cases and more will be added in the future!\n-- Spatial variables are identified by a combination of their type and name\n-- Name can contain characters, digits, spaces and following symbols: `- _ .`. The rest are reserved for future use. Spaces cannot be at the beginning & end.\n-- Each spatial variable shape supports blend distance - blend weight is calculated based on the distance from the \"outer shell\" of the shape\n-- Blend weight is used for proportional blending and priority computation\n\n- Added BoxConstant(Value/Reference)SpatialVariable\n-- The value/reference is the same throughout the whole volume\n\n- Added BoxGradientValueSpatialVariable\n-- The value changes from Start to End value along a Direction\n-- This works best when the direction is aligned with one of the axes\n\n- Added BoxVertexValueSpatialVariable\n-- Each corner of the box can have a unique value\n-- The value is interpolated based on the relative position within the box\n\n- Added Texture3D_SpatialVariable\n-- This is specifically for colorX spatial variables - you're reponsible for mapping these values to other things\n-- This is a box spatial variable that provides colorX spatial variables sampled from a Texture3D (this must be readable)\n-- You can adjust the scale/offset of the texture in local space\n-- You can either use absolute coordinates or normalized ones (normalized ones will squish/stretch with the box)\n-- You can control how the texture wraps in each of the directions\n\n- Added SphereConstant(Value/Reference)SpatialVariable\n-- The value/reference is the same throughout the whole volume\n\n- Added SphereStartEndValueSpatialVariable\n-- The value interpolates from the center to the outer edge of the SphereConstant\n\n- Added (Value/Reference/Type)SpatialVariableDriver\n-- This will drive a field with value sampled at the current global position of the slot it's on\n-- The value used is one with highest priority (highest explicit priority, then highest blend and then highest ReferenceID)\n-- You can define a default value/target\n\n- Added NumericValueSpatialVariableDriver\n-- This works specifically for numeric values and allows for multiple sampling modes:\n--- HighestPriority - this simply gives a single value that has highest priority (same as the simpler variants)\n--- WeightedAverage - all found values at particular point are averaged, with the blend weight used to weigh the values. If total blend weight is less than 1, it's blended with the default value\n--- PrioritySortedBlend - the final value is series of Lerps from the default value and then lowest priority to the highest priority values, with the blend weight of each being the lerp factor\n--- Additive - the final value is sum of all the found values multiplied by their blend weight\n\n- Added BooleanSpatialVariableDriver\n-- This is specifically for boolean values, which combines all the found bool spatial values at given point\n-- Supported combine modes are:\n--- Any - result will be true if there's at least one true value\n--- All - result will be true if all found boolean values are true\n--- XOR - each found boolean value (sorted by priority) flips the value. The initial value is the default value.\n\n- Added MinMaxValueSpatialVariableDriver\n-- This is for numeric types specifically\n-- It drives two fields (it's not necessary to have both), one with the Minimum found value at given point and one with Maximum\n-- If there's no spatial variables, Min/Max will be the Max/Min possible values for that datatype\n\n- Added ReferenceSpatialVariableCollector\n-- This is specifically for reference types\n-- This drives a list of references, filling it with all the found spatial variables\n\n- Added CloningReferenceSpatialVariableCollector\n-- This works similarly to ReferenceSpatialVariableCollectoro, but specifically for components\n-- For each component it finds at the point, it will create & maintain a duplicate\n-- It can duplicate either just the component itself or the whole Slot it's on\n-- The duplicates can be made Local only (it's your responsibility to make sure that the target list can reference local elements)\n-- It will never clone spatial variables present on the slot\n\n- Added SpatialVariableBlendDriver\n-- This combines with CloningReferenceSpatialVariableCollector\n-- If a field on a spatial variable component is driven by this component, the cloned version will be driven with the current blend weight for that clone\n-- This is used for the BlendWeight for the new reverb zones\n\n- Added ProtoFlux nodes to sample spatial variables (requested by @jackthefoxotter, issue #4215 and @unskilledwolf, issue #4216)\n-- Sample(Value/Object)SpatialVariable<T> - works with any time, samples the highest priority one at given point\n-- SampleNumericSpatialVariable<T> - works with numeric types, supports various way to combine them (same as component)\n-- SampleMinMaxSpatialVariable<T> - works with numeric types - finds the Min & Max value at certain point and whether any was found at all\n-- SampleBooleanSpatialVariable - samples boolean variables with multiple modes to combine them (same as the component) \n\n[h3]Other stuff[/h3]\n- Added SetActive actions to the Skybox and AmbientLightSH2 components (requested by @aegis_wolf and @ryuvi, issue #4218, implemented by @ryuvi)\n-- This allows you to set an instance of either component as the \"active\" one via ProtoFlux, button action triggers, etc.\n- Added IsActive bools to the Skybox and AmbientLightSH2 components (requested by @aegis_wolf and @ryuvi, issue #4218, implemented by @ryuvi)\n-- This is a read-only field on each component which is true if that instance of the component is the currently active one.\n\n- Added \"RunAfterFinalPoseUpdate\" to PositionAtUser to run a second update after user's final pose for the frame has been computed\n-- This only works when the target user is local user (either through TargetUser or PositionAtLocalUser)\n-- It runs a second update outside of normal update cycle specifically after the user's final pose has been computed to ensure the slot is positioned to the latest value\n-- This fixes listener root falling behind when moving fast (reported by @ohzee, @bluecyro, @dustysprinkles, @epiceaston197, brecert and others, issue #4251)\n\n- Added ReferenceList<T> component\n\n[h2]Tweak:[/h2]\n- IgnoreReverbZones is now IgnoreAudioEffects on AudioOutput\n-- It functions largerly the same, but it will skip all effects on a listener\n-- In the future we'll expand the system\n- ViewPosition & ViewRotation nodes now actually position based on the actual target user (e.g. on PositionAtUser), rather than the local user\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Mongolian locale update by modimobeikete\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Reworked resampling mechanism for CircularAudioBuffer to fix incorrect math\n-- This fixes audio sizzling artifacts when using non-48 kHz audio devices (reported by @martysh12, issue #4072)\n- Fixed exceptions in LegacyAudioPlayer when some pieces are missing\n- Fixed references between multiple components not transferring properly when a group of components is cloned together to a different slot\n- Fixed clipping audio samples not limiting the negative amplitude (reported by @Nytra, issue #4208)\n- Fixed Enum shifting skipping enum members which have variants that have been marked obsolete (based on report by @Zyro1331, @shdw_x, issue #4206)\n- Fixed MultiValueTextFormatDriver showing obsolete names of enums used as arguments (based on report by @Zyro1331, @shdw_x, issue #4206)\n- Improved robustness of disposing of systems when disposing worlds (e.g. when they are closed) which prevented subsystems from being disposed when there are errors disposing other systems\n-- This fixes audio system not getting disposed in case of errors with other systems, causing audio to continue playing (reported by @yoshiyoshiyoshiyoshiyoshyoshyosh, issue #4249)\n- Fixed inconsistent generic type validation, resulting in some systems not validating some generic types\n-- This fixes being able to instantiate or load certain generic types (based on report by @Tobs2007, @Zozokasu and @UnskilledWolf, issue #4282)\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I got a normal build for you for a change! I've been mostly busy with Awwdio, but there's a few things that got merged in, mostly contributions from other team members, so I'm pushing out a bit of a maintenance build!\n\nThere's a bunch of fixes to native libraries - Compressonator & Brotli got updated and should now work properly on Linux thanks to @probableprime (with some help from @j4.lc and @yoshiyoshiyoshiyoshiyoshyoshyosh)! This could potentially fix the high CPU usage when baking reflection probes too thanks to Compressonator update, but you'll have to test.\n\nSurprisingly this one is compatible with previous! Though update is recommended.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added `/getSharedStorage` command to allow users view their currently shared storage (requested by @jackthefoxotter, issue #3131, implemented by @dantetucker)\n\n- Added ability to ask Resonite to test your proxy configuration at startup and optionally shutdown resonite if the proxy is invalid (issue #3966, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This is useful is business/security installations where a proxy is required and if it is down you want to not even try running Resonite.\n-- To opt-in to this testing if you use a proxy add \"required\" and/or \"test\" to your proxy configuration. See the wiki for more info: <https://wiki.resonite.com/Proxy_Support#Testing>\nAdded Better Logging for cases of when FrooxEngine crashes due to: DuplicateInstances and aforementioned proxy test failures. These specific messages link directly to wiki pages designed to help you resolve the issues. There may be opportunities for more instances of crashes being improved in this manner.\n- Added `loginRequired` to headless configurations (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- When set to true, the headless will shutdown if the provided headless credentials do not work\n-- This can be helpful for business or secure installations of the headless.\n\n- Added MMC25 volunteer badges (requested by @medravr)\n-- These will be assigned soon!\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- HTTP access requests are now port-specific, meaning that allowing them for specific port will allow access only for that port (based on security ticket #493941 by @zenuru, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This prevents cases where allowing access to any localhost port would allow scanning all the other ports\n-- Exiting instances should behave as they used to - if you want to change them, we recommend deleting them and re-allowing access\n-- You might end up seeing more host access dialogs as a result, but this is a tradeoff for better security & control\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Improved loading of Steam related APIs, particularly on headlesses to enable more concise logging of failures (requested by a business client, implemented by @probableprime)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc and @0_vex_0\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged new Mongolian locale by modimobeikete\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed Brotli.Net failing to load correctly within the Headless on Linux (reported by @yoshiyoshyosh, issue #95, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed Compressonator not being available on Linux headlesses for Asset Processing (implemented by @probableprime, with public contributions from @j4.lc and @yoshiyoshiyoshiyoshiyoshyoshyosh)\n-- This also updates to a newer version of Compressonator, which could fix issues where baking BC6H on specific CPU's causes everything to freeze (reported by @modernballoonie, @zyzylian, @toxic_cookie, @sctanf, @jackthefoxotter, @ultrawidegamer, @kulza, issue #1983)\n",

And cylinder crop for the Gaussian Splat tool + a bunch of bugfixes and tweaks for it.\n\nA bunch of other fixes too, like the context menu color fixes that @probableprime did, fix for the yt-dlp cookies from browser not working properly and some other improvements.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Exposed Additive blend mode on GradientSkyMaterial (implemented by @bluecyro, issue #4006)\n- Added cylinder crop for Gaussian Splats (requested by @aegis_wolf, @rueshejn, issue #3997)\n-- This is available on the Gaussian Splat Tool with visual\n-- You can also call this directly on the static asset provider with ProtoFlux\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- When drawing a crop shape for Gaussian Splat Tool it is now aligned with the direction you're currently facing\n- Gaussian Splat Tool will now automatically update the point cloud colliders on clipped Gaussian Splats\n- Changed default stereo separation for photo gesture from 65 mm to 16 mm\n-- This generally seems to produce much nicer to look at photos in most situations\n-- If your setting was set to 65 mm, it'll be automatically changed to 16 mm. This is so users who haven't touched existing setting have better value. You can change it back to 65 mm afterwards if you prefer.\n- Updated yt-dlp from 2025.03.27 to 2025.03.31\n- Added mechanism to auto-register settings on startup, to ensure that commonly used settings will always show up (based on request by @nytra, issue #3822)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Finnish locale update by @airride91 \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Resolved conflicting sources of color for context menu items on many standard tools that was causing large amounts of log lines (reported by ko-tengu, issue #4008, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fix static asset providers with freshly changed URL indicating that the asset is available before the previous asset is unloaded\n-- This fixes some timing issues - e.g. when processing function updates the URL and the updates asset is attempted to be processed - this would previously use the previous asset, rather than the new one\n- Tweaked compute buffer layout when uploading gaussian splat data to potentially fix crash on AMD cards with certain quality settings (based on report by @zyro1331, issue #3899)\n-- Unfortunately I can't test this as I don't have AMD GPU\n- Fixed OnAttach() being called when loading asset dependency components (based on report by @stiefeljackal, issue #4012)\n-- This fixes legacy instances of FlatLitToon not loading properly\n- Fixed legacy instances of Image not loading properly (found in a log from @stiefeljackal, issue #4012)\n- Fixed Cookies From Browser option for yt-dlp not working correctly (reported by @zangooseoo, ikubaysan, @h33t, @forgottensin, issue #3800)\n- Fix \"Save Screenshot\" option not showing/hiding properly in some cases\n-- The option will now show for custom-captured items by the user (e.g. custom cameras)\n-- The option will be properly hidden when spawning screenshots that are already saved on your account\n",

I got a very exciting build for you today, with a number of revolutionary features, tweaks and bugfixes, which will elevate Resonite to the next level of social VR platforms!\n\nMany people say that Resonite is really hard to get into, so we said to ourselves... what if we made it even harder to use? If you feel up to the challenge, there's a new difficulty setting, allowing you to go from Normal to Hard! How long can you last?\n\nWe also get a number of complaints about low performance, so we added a toggle that literally doubles your FPS number! It's that easy, I don't know why we were spending all this time on performance update. But if you still lag anyways, we made sure that it actually hurts now, so everyone around you can know of your suffering. There's even new \"IsUserLagging\" ProtoFlux node so you can code your own visuals to happen!\n\nSocial VR platforms also couldn't exist without their bread and butter... mirrors! Have you ever noticed though that stuff in mirrors is backwards? How are you supposed to read text like that, it's all wrong! No longer! We're introducing a new revolutionary fix that makes mirrors not mirrored, making Resonite the state of the art of social VR technology.\n\nIf you'd like to play with these new features, head over to Settings -> Misc and explore what this build has to offer! There's a number of other goodies and we'll leave those as a surprise.\n\nAnd if you enjoy these features half as much as I enjoyed coding them, considers sharing some of them with the community and on social media, to show everyone all the new exciting possibilities that Resonite now offers!\n\n[previewyoutube=rREJnD3zfww;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added Difficulty setting\n-- If you no longer feel challenged by Resonite, you can switch to Hard game difficulty for extra challenge\n-- Easy mode is not available yet as we're missing some prerequisites\n- Added toggle to double the FPS\n-- It will literally double your FPS number!\n- Added Expressiveness setting\n-- If you feel that avatars not expressive enough, you can now increase their expressiveness with ease\n- Added Phantom Sense setting\n-- If you do not have phantom sense by default, you can now turn it on in the Settings\n- Added some more toggles\n- Added G̴͔̲͘ḣ̶͙̳͒ò̵̟s̸̨̀t̴̳͉͑̀s̶̳͓̈́̒\n-- Don't let them in\n--- Seriously, don't let them in\n---- No, I really mean it, don't let them in\n----- STOP!

      "contents": "Hello everyone!\n\nI got some more goodies for you! There's some more additions for the Gaussian Splats - there's now a tool for doing basic editing! You can crop them visually in-game! I'd like to do more fancier and fine grained editing in the future, but that's a lot more work. This one was a very quick add and should help with basic cleanup in-game.\n\nThere's a new module for PhotonDust too! This one was just 5 minutes of work, but should allow for neat effects!\n\nThere's a whole bunch of bugfixes too for things and tweaks to improve quality of life and stability.\n\nThe rest of the week might be a quieter though, as I'll have a bunch of MMC responsibilities and will probably be working on Awwdio, which will take a bit before it forms into something testable.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added GaussianSplatTool for basic visual editing of Gaussian Splats\n-- Currently this tool allows to visually crop Gaussian Splats either by box or sphere\n-- Use primary to draw the crop region. Then secondary to initiate the crop.\n-- Currently the tool has basic visuals. We'll have content team make improved visuals soon\n-- In the future, the tool will also allow for more fine grained & real-time editing, but for now it allows basic cropping, which was quick enough to add\n-- You can find it under Resonite Essentials/Tools/Misc\n-- It will crop any Gaussian Splats that overlap the selected region (in case there are multiple)\n\n- Added Advanced Settings for Gaussian Splat quality\n-- This lets you configure formats of individual data buffers\n-- This is recommended for specific use-cases only - use the templates unless you need this\n-- This can be used to help diagnose crashes with specific GPU's (@zyro1331, @reddneko ko-tengu, AwesomeTornado, issue #3899, @.fulgens, issue #3935)\n\n- Added OrientAtPoint PhotonDust module to orient particles at certain point (requested by @ultrawidegamer, issue #3913)\n-- This will make particles face a single target point in arbitrary space\n-- You need to use this with \"Local\" for particle alignment mode so the rotations are displayed properly\n\n- Added OverrideParent to DuplicateSlot node (requested by @colin.cat, @rockstarraccoon, issue #3869)\n-- When not null, the duplicate will be created directly under the new parent\n\n- Added SaveProxy component to replace ReferenceProxy behavior of redirecting item saves\n-- This fixes items with ReferenceProxy with Target Slot not being able to be saved (reported by @jackthefoxotter, @bluecyro, issue #3877)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Removed obsolete explicit delegate references on RandomObjectSpawner (reported by @art0007i, issue #3936)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged English locale fix by @muppeq \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed \"Save Here\" functionality not working for World Orbs (reported by @lexevo, @ardescar, @banane9, @nytra, issue #910, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed crash when using FormatLocaleString node with locale strings with arguments (reported by @dustysprinkles, brecert, @art0007i, issue #3934)\n- Fixed invalid particle raycasts causing logspam (reported by @mrhedx., @bluecyro and @jackthefoxotter, issue #3932)\n- Fixed disabled/inactive reflection probes updating & causing excessive coroutine accumulation and performance degradation when in OnChanges mode (reported by @readun, @firefly2422, @zahndy, issue #3819, @ohzee, @pizza.hut, @nutcake, @shockcoil, @its_fawn, issue #3938)\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone!\n\nI've got another chunk of Gaussian Splats support work for you, significantly improving their performance! Resonite and the asset variant system now supports generating VRAM compressed variants - these use significantly less VRAM (up to 18.62x times less), load faster (the files are smaller) and render faster too (less memory bandwidth usage on the GPU).\n\nThis also means that you can now import bigger splats than before without them killing your VRAM and performance as a result. My own 3 million splats render quite noticeably faster with this and make my computer die less. \n\nAnd the best part, it all fits into our asset variant system - you don't need to do anything extra! Any already uploaded gaussian splats benefit from this automatically as well as any new ones you upload - our system will generate the variants as needed.\n\nYou can select the quality of splats (and how much VRAM they use) in settings - the system should pick a good value based on your VRAM amount by default though, so most of the time you might not need to change anything at all.\n\nThere's some other extras! Because some of the compression variants use k-Means Clustering algorithm, I've also adapted it as a texture processing method! You can paletize/stylize your textures with a new processing option as a small bonus!\n\nThere's also some privacy oriented features - you can now selectively disable/allow platform interfaces like Discord/Steam thanks to @probableprime's work.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added support for VRAM compression for gaussian splats to improve their performance\n-- This is a lossy compression that reduces the size of the gaussian splats in the VRAM (as well for download)\n-- This also significantly improves rendering performance at lower quality levels due to less GPU bandwidth usage\n-- Quality levels are: Very High (uncompressed), High (2.94x smaller), Medium (5.14x smaller), Low (14x smaller), VeryLow (18.62x smaller)\n-- You can set your quality level in the Graphics settings\n-- Default is automatically determined by amount of available VRAM in your system\n- Added \"Minimum locally compressed quality\" setting\n-- For locally imported splats, the quality will never go lower than this setting\n-- This is due to the very low qualities being very heavy and time consuming to compress and they should only be compressed in the cloud\n-- The VRAM compression implementation is a port based on this project: <https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting>\n\n- Added GaussianSplatAssetMetadata for providing stats for a Gaussian Splat assets (requested by @raidriar796, issue #3871)\n-- Those stats are visualized on StaticGaussianSplatProvided in the inspector for currently loaded splat\n-- This currently provides: Number of splats, VRAM usage (raw value + formatted) and actual loaded variant\n\n- Added KMeansCluster method for processing textures\n-- This will cluster the colors/pixel positions using K-means clustering algorithm.\n-- This can be useful for stylizing & creating various effects\n\n- Added `disallowedPlatformInterfaces` and `allowedPlatformInterfaces` to Config.json (requested by ko-tengu, issue #3780, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This allows disabling/allowing platform interfaces by name\n-- This can be used to completely disable Steam and Discord related functionality by specifying the value `[\"Discord\", \"Steam\"]`\n-- The disallow list will specifically block particular platform interfaces, but allow all others\n-- The allow list will disable all interfaces other than specified ones. Specify `[]` if you want to disable all of them. Specify `null` to allow all of them (other than explicitly disabled ones)\n\n- Provide `universePublicDashOnly` which allows universes that only want to use the default dash layout\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- GaussianSplat Quality Settings is now per-machine\n- Rendering Quality Settings are now per machine\n\n- When in a Universe, the Universe's primary group ID is used in the world browser for filtering (implemented by @probableprime )\n- When in a Universe, the `appName` in locale strings now uses the universe name (implemented by @probableprime)\n- Added filter preset name to buttons' slot name within the filter facet (implemented by @probableprime)\n\n- Renamed GlowingSphereToggle to LegacyGlowingSphereToggle (based on report by @dustysprinkles, brecert, issue #3886)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged English locale fixes by @muppeq \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed SPZ gaussian splat imports being inverted on the X axis (reported by @shininghero, @anquietas_sys, @bredo, @dustysprinkles, issue #3872)\n- Fixed SPZ files not being decoded fully in some cases (e.g. when running under .NET 9)\n- Fixed bug that prevented worlds from being opened when in a universe and not using port restrictions (fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed deleted user accounts not being removed from groups on wipe (reported by @ardescar, @dantetucker, issue #3867, fixed by @dantetucker)\n- Ensure that additional metadata (supporter, entitlements, old username changes) are wiped when accounts are deleted\n-- All previously-undeleted data for wiped accounts has now been deleted with the above changes\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm happy to finally release initial native support for Gaussian Splats in Resonite! This is a pet project I've been working on and off for a while, that it got pushed off by PhotonDust, Stripe and a bunch of other things, but now it's finally here!\n\nYou can import Gaussian Splats into Resonite, render them (even in VR), do basic editing (bounding box/sphere clipping) and export them back out!\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Gaussian Splats are (relatively) novel way of representing and rendering scenes. It's often produced by 3D scanning real world and it can achieve very high amount of fidelity - often the 3D scanned scenes will look very real life like - you could say this is the \"real life update\"! :D\n\nAlso important note - they are pretty heavy on the HW - especially GPU and VRAM usage, so be careful with them! The bigger the splat, the heavier it gets! Treat them as a very high poly mesh - if you wouldn't spawn that into a populated session, don't spawn a splat!\n\nI am still working on VRAM compression, which should come in the following days and will significantly reduce their VRAM usage, so keep tuned for more improvements to this and report any issues you find (but read the details below first please).\n\nThere is also a setting in Graphics setting for the rate at which the splats are sorted - lowering the value will lower the GPU usage, but result in more graphical artifacts when you change the viewpoint rapidly. We expect this to get much better once we switch away from Unity fully in the future and can use more modern GPU features.\n\nThere's also some other fixes and optimizations as well! Notably a fix that sometimes makes headless lock up on some worlds.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added initial support for Gaussian Splat importing & rendering (requested by @mralex3078, @martnd., issue #2199)\n-- Desktop & VR rendering is both supported\n-- PLY & SPZ file formats are supported\n--- When importing from PLY, 3D model import dialog will be shown. You need to select \"Gaussian Splat\" if the PLY is Gaussian Splat (the system is not able to auto-detect this currently)\n--- If you find a file that doesn't import properly make a bug report!\n-- **IMPORTANT:** Please note that gaussian splats can be quite heavy on GPU & VRAM usage. Be responsible when bringing them to worlds - treat them same as you'd a very high poly mesh\n-- I'm working on porting VRAM compression for the splats, which will reduce their VRAM impact significantly, this will be release soon!\n-- Due to limitations of our Unity version, less efficient sorting algorithm is currently used. Sorting speed can be adjusted in Graphic settings to improve GPU load or speed up sorting. When the sorting speed is low, changing viewpoint quickly will lead to temporary graphical artifacts\n-- When importing splats from PLY format, option to recompress them to SPZ is offered - this will significantly save on storage space\n-- Simple point cloud based collider + shape around origin is added on import\n-- Rendering implementation is based on: <https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting>\n-- C# port of SPZ library implemented by @bluecyro and available at: <https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Spz.NET>\n-- Blending between two gaussian splat renderers is not supported\n\n- Added GaussianSplatRenderer component, responsible for rendering the splats\n-- SizeScale & OpacityScale can be used to adjust the size/opacity of the rendered splats - this is mostly for diagnostic purposes\n-- MaxSHOrder allows you to restrict the order of spherical harmonics used to compute the color - lowering this number will make the splats not change color based on the direction you look at them from correctly\n-- SphericalHarmonicsOnly - this will only use the higher order spherical harmonics exclude the base color - this is mostly for diagnostic purposes to visualize contribution of the spherical harmonics\n\n- Added StaticGaussianSplat component\n-- This provides a static gaussian splat asset\n-- It supports a number of simple processing methods for basic gaussian splat editing that can be called with ProtoFlux\n--- ClipWithBoundingBox - clips any splats outside of a bounding box (with optional orientation)\n--- ClipWithSphere - clips any splats outside of a sphere\n\n- Added GaussianSplatExportable to allow exporting gaussian splats from Resonite\n-- You can use this to export edited gaussian splats\n-- Exporting both in PLY & SPZ is supported\n\n- Added DiagnosticGaussianSplat\n-- This is a procedural gaussian splat, where you can specify individual splats\n-- This is mostly meant for diagnostic purposes as well for learning about gaussian splats and how they work\n\n- Added NullParticleRenderer which doesn't render the particles themselves (requested by @baxterottoman, issue #3847)\n-- This is useful if you want to render only the trails/ribbons/lights, without the billboards for each particle\n-- It's more efficient than setting billboard sizes to zero or making them fully transparent, as it completely skips processing & generating geometry for particle billboards\n\n- Added admin commands for diagnosing Stripe supporter information to help with support tickets (implemented by @dantetucker)\n-- This is internal feature, but will help improve responses at support.resonite.com \n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Optimize memory usage when encoding meshes with Plain/LZ4 encoding\n-- This also fixes running out of memory with those encodings for extremely large meshes\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Korean locale update @mirpasec \n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged English locale fixes by @muppeq \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed user credit type not being assigned properly (based on report by @carsoncoder)\n- Fixed race condition in LocalMeshProvider, which could result in the engine hanging indefinitely, notably on headless (based on report by @foxbox., @bwgi with recent event)\n- Fixed SignalR not getting properly initialized at startup when auto-login isn't enabled",

This is cleaning up a bunch of smaller things that needed some love for a long while, but were pushed out by bigger work on PhotonDust and other stuff and a bunch of other treats to break up the development a bit from the big stuff a little.\n\nThere's also a new bonus module for PhotonDust inspired by a game I started playing recently, allowing for even more cool effects! I can't wait to see what you'll make with it!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added OriginRadialForce module for PhotonDust\n-- This is similar to RadialForce module, except the center is implicitly the original position that the particle was emitted from in the coordinate space of the particle system\n- Added Squared & Linear radial force modes\n-- The previous linear is renamed to InverseLinear & auto-updated\n-- Those modes work inversely from the previous too - the force gets stronger the further away the particle is from the center\n- Added Min/MaxForce to the RadialForce to limit the resulting force applied to the particles\n\n- Added \"Use cookies from browser\" setting for yt-dlp (requested by @zangooseoo, issue #3800)\n-- You can use this if videos from streaming services (like YouTube) don't load from you by selecting which browser you use\n-- Supported browsers are: Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, Brave, Chromium, Opera, Vivaldi and Whale\n\n- Added \"Open autosave path for current world\" button to Photo Capture Settings to open inventory location for the current world (requested by me, issue #3248)\n-- This makes it easy to open the folder where photos are being autosaved for the current world based on your path formatting\n\n- Added \"Sticky Grab\" option to interactions\n-- When enabled, first press of grab starts holding items, second press releases\n-- This is useful when you want to hold something for longer period of time without having to press the button\n-- The toggle is in \"Grabbing\" submenu on each hand. The hand grab types were moved to this submenu as well to consolidate\n-- This only affects worldspace grabbing\n-- This is in VR only currently (we can enable this for desktop too if there's interest)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Added helpful logging messages for exceptions related to loading a world by url within headless (reported by @Tobs2007, issue #3518)\n\n- Significantly improved accuracy of implicit body colliders for dynamic bones, especially with full body (requested by me, issue #1567)\n-- Chest colliders are now significantly more precise, which should prevent them from pushing dynamic bones up when lying down\n-- Arms & Legs now have precise colliders as well as part of the body, that follow each arm/leg, alongside with elbow/knee\n- Improved calculation of user's feet position - if the feet are not tracked, the system will fall back on the IK feet position if available\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @rabbuttz \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq & @cameron5\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc\n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread, t91a60 and @torrndraws\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed exceptions when emitters try to unregister themselves with already removed particle system \n- Fixed mesh emitter colors from texture being flipped on the Y axis (reported by sjsanjsrh, issue #3362)\n-- This only affects new instances, existing instances are auto-upgraded to preserve old behavior - if you already fixed it yourself, your fix should stay\n- Fixed FireOnChange with references causing crashes when input is a local element (reported by @jackthefoxotter, issue #3686)\n-- Note that local elements will effectively be treated as null by this node - they only exist locally and cannot be tracked globally by the node\n",

I've decided to prioritize a smaller thing to help with some of the social friction with users being in inaccessible worlds - Invite Requests!\n\nThey're designed to be smart - e.g. someone requests invite from you and you can't invite them (e.g. Private session and you're not the host) you can just forward it to host with a single press of button. If host is headless, it'll forward it to handlers automatically too - and they can either send one time invite or add the user as contact directly from the invite request.\n\nThe overall goal was to make it as frictionless as possible. It won't solve all the \"people are in private/hidden worlds\" problem completely, but hopefully this helps make things easier and remove some of the anxiety!\n\nHope you enjoy the feature! There might be still some quirks and tweaks needed, so make issues if you run into problems.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added invite requests (requested by @www.sizemo.re, @archietheraccoon, @kulza, @imerin., Valnarr, issue #255)\n-- You can send it from the Contacts UI\n-- This is designed to remove as much friction as possible when getting people into sessions and will smartly handle a number of conditions\n-- If you can't join user directly and they're online, the \"Join\" button will be \"Ask To Join\" instead\n-- If the user can't invite you directly (e.g. Private/Contacts only session and they're not host), they can forward the request to host\n-- If the host is headless, it'll automatically forward it to invite handlers for that session\n-- If the host/handlers grant invite, it's automatically forwarded all the way back to the original user\n-- The host/handler can also add the user as a contact (for handlers, this adds the user as contact of the headless host)\n-- The handler does not need to be in the same session to handle the invite\n-- The host/handler don't need to be Contact of the user who wants to be invited\n\n- Added `inviteRequestHandlerUsernames` configuration for headless worlds\n-- Any users in this list will be forwarded invite requests sent to the headless host\n-- The users in the list must be contacts with the headless host for this to work\n-- Headless also automatically forwards invite requests to any users present in the session with \"Admin\" role\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Significantly mitigated UI Z-Fighting by increasing the OffsetUnits parameter on the UI panel backing material to 4000.\n-- This should significantly improve the readability of UI at reasonable distances from the world origin and when UI-aligned in desktop mode.\n",

I got another smaller build for you, but with a bunch of cleanup!\n\nThere's fixes for two PhotonDust issues that popped up after the legacy particle removal, cleaning that up.\n\nAlso I spent most of the time narrowing down a hard crash. I found the exact cause and applied a workaround (essentially adding more stack space for tree queries x3) which fixes the current issue, but I'll have to make report to Bepu for a full fix.\n\nThe build is compatible with previous, so update at your leisure (or when you are affected by those particular bugs).\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed particle trails sometimes glitching out to a wrong position, causing rendering artifacts (reported by @orange3134, issue #3762)\n-- This was done by restructuring how the second segment of trails is calculated - it used to be calculated too early, before the particle itself was simulated - in case it was never updated later on, it would stay in its wrong state\n- Fixed particles made with brush tools set to CloneComponent mode disappearing when the brush is deleted (reported by @orange3134, issue #3761)\n-- The brush tool now clones the renderer & all particle modules on the style when in this mode\n- Fixed exceptions in Color(X)MemberEditor when it's misconfigured and the target field is missing\n- Increased maximum tree traversal depth in Bepu physics\n-- This fixes hard crash with certain worlds and collider setups (reported by @zangooseoo, @modernballoonie, @scraner, @m7_emmy, @joshtiger, issue #3758)\n-- Note that this mostly just \"postpones\" the issue, it's still possible for the crash to occur with certain setups. Full fix requires more complex changes to Bepu: <https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2/issues/354>",

This concludes a major milestone of the performance update, bringing us much closer to being able to run FrooxEngine under .NET 9, with only the audio system rework standing in the way of the actual \"splittening\"!\n\nThank you everyone for all your reports! At this point I've spent probably about two months fixing up various compatibility issues to make the conversion near perfect to preserve old content and I couldn't do it without all your reports and samples! As long as you don't overwrite your original copies, we can still fix conversion issues even after this swap too.\n\nThere are many more things for PhotonDust in the future - we now have our own system, pretty much fully under our control, but for the time being I'm going to refocus on the next goals to bring us closer to the big performance update.\n\nThere's another notable change - namely our headless has been unified between Windows & Linux, so both can run from a single install! For now there's still Windows & Linux slot, but the Linux one will be removed soon.\n\nAlso, the world browser has been updated to MMC25 category! If you submit your entry early (which you should to avoid stress), it'll appear there!\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Removed Legacy Particle System, completing major performance update milestone to replace it with custom system (issue #587)\n-- All items are now automatically converted to PhotonDust **on spawn**\n-- This removes a significant tie to Unity, as this system was FrooxEngine-Unity hybrid\n-- If you find conversion issues at this point **do not overwrite** the old item/world - the conversion can run again as long as you have original copy!\n\n- Fixed world list updating unnecessarily when the tab is unfocused or dash is closed (reported by @zyro1331, issue #2970, fixed by @bluecyro)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Updated MMC category in the world browser to MMC25\n-- This will now show all the MMC25 submissions that have been submitted so far! Submit yours early if you can so it appears there!\n\n- Unified Windows & Linux headless into one build that's compatible with both platforms (based on issue #3050, implemented by @bluecyro)\n-- This is a preparation for deprecation of the Linux branch on Steam - you will get the same headless from the Windows branch\n-- With this change, we use the .NET runtime mechanisms to load platform-appropriate versions of libraries\n-- This also paves the way for the headless running well on other architectures in the future, such as ARM (currently this is NOT supported officially as of right now, but this brings it closer)\n\n- When changing username on Resonite, it'll now also be updated on Stripe end (implemented by @gawdl3y)\n-- This will help the support team better match Stripe subscriptions in case of username changes\n\n- Categorized ValueReceiver, ReferenceReceiver and AssetReceiver components under UIX/Interaction (based on report by @grand__, @nytra, issue #3749)\n- Renamed ReferenceGrabReceiver to ReferenceReceiver to unify its naming scheme (based on report by @grand__, @nytra, issue #3749)\n-- This is a non-generic version of the receiver. Generally I recommend using the generic version where possible as it allows specifying exact type\n-- Added \"Undoable\" field to this version to unify it with other variants\n\n- Updated yt-dlp from 2024.12.23 to 2025.01.26\n\n[h2]Removals:[/h2]\n- Removed BooleanUserOverride component (based on question from livestream)\n-- This component was uncategorized and did nothing",

I'm now pretty confident in its state, since the issues have slowed down significantly and have been mostly simple regressions. Because of that, I have important announcement:\n\n[b]IMPORTANT:[/b] The Legacy Particle System will be removed this upcoming Monday!\n\nThis will finalize the initial PhotonDust implementation and a major milestone towards the big performance update! Thank you everyone who participated in the testing :3\n\nThere will be more PhotonDust features in the future, but I'll likely refocus on the next tasks for the performance update first, which will be the audio system.\n\nI'll be updating `prerelease` with the latest fixes in a bit.\n\nOh and this build is compatible with previous!\n\n[b]New Features:[/b]\n- Add debug statistics for particle state uploads (currently visible in the Debug dialog on the Worlds page)\n\n[b]Optimizations:[/b]\n- Skip particle buffer submissions when the particle system is empty (based on report by @orange3134, issue #3301)\n- Use separate processing queue for uploading particle simulation results for rendering to improve particle smoothness (based on report by @orange3134, issue #3301)\n-- This makes sure that the particle simulation results don't fight for processing time with other asset uploads (meshes, textures, materials...)\n-- The particle upload queue also has more time for processing. This means with heavy loads it can lower FPS at bit more (we can tweak how much), but will reduce jerkiness of particle systems in some conditions\n\n[b]Fixes:[/b]\n- Fixed extremely short particle trails (with only two points) being glitchy and stretching too long in some cases (based on report by @nytra, issue #3716)\n-- Note: The legacy particle system actually has a glitchy behavior as well, with the second point of the particle not updating smoothly. PhotonDust fixes this, making it animate smoothly on its end. This is intended change, even though it produces small visual difference.\n- Fixed regression causing LineEmitters with fixed emission direction resetting the direction to zero (reported by @orange3134, issue #3381)\n",

This is mostly preparatory work, however you can apply it to audio clip assets with static processing with ProtoFlux.\n\nAlso some improvements from @probableprime's work on the asset variant system that have trickled into the main build now as well as improving date/time formatting to match people's locale.\n\nMore coming soon! And remember, we're still doing the final `prerelease` testing of PhotonDust on the other branch, see the update before this one for more!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added stats/fundingStats API endpoint which contains aggregate statistics for Resonite's support\n-- Both current (active tiers) and historical aggregates are computed\n-- Aggregate for all services and per service (Patreon/Stripe) are provided\n-- Data per-tier is also provided\n\n- Added FundingStatistics component\n-- This provides in-game access to the common aggregate funding metadata\n-- It's under Cloud/Indicators\n\n- Added `-RestoreCloudSettingsFile <path to file>` argument to restore your cloud settings from a saved copy\n-- This can be used in situations where you lose your settings and you have backup. It'll override the loaded settings from the file you provided (typically brson)\n-- DO NOT share your settings file with anyone - they may contain very sensitive personal data\n-- DO NOT use this to exchange settings with other users! This is not designed for sharing your settings. Doing so might compromise your account or cause corruption and other issues. This is for personal backup/restore purposes only!\n\n- Added Pattern enum to CurrentDateTimeTextDriver which allows using standardized date/time formatting patterns (based on report by @namminamm, issue #185, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This makes the component use the most appropriate formatting depending on user's Locale\n-- Old behavior is preserved via OverrideFormat - when this contains a pattern, it'll be used instead\n\n- Integrated reverb effect from SoundPipe library (implemented by @bluecyro, issue #2708)\n-- This is primarily preparation work for implementing reverb zones for the upcoming audio system\n-- You can apply the effect to static audio files currently by calling the ApplyZitaReverb method with ProtoFlux\n-- Use ConstructZitaParameters under \"Audio\" to construct the reverb parameters\n-- In the future this will also be exposed through other means, e.g. with the ProtoFlux audio DSP once it's implemented\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Improved detection of imagine file format when loading textures (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- We now prioritize the MIME type of the image if available rather than the extension which can incorrect or missing\n-- This improves speed of loading textures and generating asset variants (both locally and in cloud)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged British English locale update by @bredo \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed legacy CylinderEmitter that is emitting from the cylinder volume not emitting in the same direction after conversion (reported by @nytra, issue #3699)\n- Fixed null reference exceptions when detecting texture types, causing errors when generating asset variants (fixed by @probableprime)",

In case you wonder why we sometimes don't allow values out of certain ranges - this is why x3\n\nI should have a fix tomorrow though, which should wrap up some last bits of PhotonDust. Just as a reminder - the Legacy particle system will go poof very soon! We don't recommend using it for any new projects at this point.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added AngularVelocityDrag module for PhotonDust (requested by @mr.redstar, @luxkitty, issue #3639)\n-Added ConstantAngularVelocityForce module for PhotonDust\n-- This applies a constant angular acceleration to the particles\n-- It requires the RotationSimulationModule to function\n- Added LerpUnclamped support for SphericalHarmonics\n-- This fixes crash when trying to use ValueLerpUnclamped node (reported by @luxkitty, issue #3620)\n- Fix exceptions when checking validity of ProtoFlux node visuals when the target node has been deleted, but visual hasn't (found in a log from @nytra, @luxkitty, issue #3635)\n- Added SizeMultiplierByVelocity module for PhotonDust\n-- This allows multiplying the size based on the velocity\n-- The multiplier can be clamped within a certain range as well as the resulting size\n-- You can also mask which axes of the size are affected by this\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed legacy particles with length/velocity scaling and zero velocity being visible after conversion to PhotonDust (based on report by @ultrawidegamer, issue #3628)\n- Added read lock to mesh data for mesh emitters\n-- This prevents PhotonDust from breaking when the procedural mesh data is being updated (reported by @nytra, @luxkitty, issue #3635)\n-- This only affects procedural meshes as those can be updated on the fly. Static meshes don't require locking and are more efficient to emit from\n- Fixed particles in Facing mode rolling with head (reported by @veercollie, issue #3626)\n\n- Added retry logic to fetching asset metadata from CloudFlare when crucial information is missing\n-- This fixes a transient error, when freshly uploaded blobs are sometimes missing information, causing syncing to break (@reddneko, @elaina6254, @orange3134, @bredo, @zahndy, @nytra, @lynrayy, issue #3629)\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I got a whole bunch of things for you today!\n\nFirst, you now have full control over the global ambient lighting in the world! The automatic calculation from the skybox is now also controlled from FrooxEngine side with a new set of components - including one that efficiently computes the parameters from a reflection probe with a Compute Shader. This is way faster and more efficient than Unity's own method, making ambient light changes significantly faster and smoother.\n\nBig thanks to @troyborg, @epiceaston197, VirgilCore, @modernballoonie and @rockstarraccoon for helping to test this in `prerelease`. Fortunately there weren't really many issues with this reported over last two weeks, so it should be good to go - but if you still run into something, make a report and we'll fix it in subsequent builds.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about how this new system works, we covered it in the recent episode of The Resonance: \n\n[previewyoutube=Hyv2s364DPU;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nSecond, PhotonDust is now out of experimental phase! Majority of the remaining issues (including legacy conversion) are now resolved - it's good to start using for new projects and convert your old into it and continue on! The conversion isn't automatic yet - this will happen when the Legacy system is removed fully.\n\nThe legacy particle system still exists for a little bit, but it will be removed very soon! If you run into some issues, please report them while you can! I'll probably remove the legacy system sometime next week, assuming there's no big blockers.\n\nThere's a number of bugfixes too from @probableprime, which should resolve some issues and regressions!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added AmbientLightSH2 component to control the ambient light in the world\n-- This functions similarly to the Skybox component, where there will be one active component that is determining what the current ambient lighting is\n-- The ambient light is parameterized using second order spherical harmonics\n\n- Added ReflectionProbeSH2\n-- This computes Spherical Harmonics (of order 2) based on the current texture of the target Reflection Probe\n-- The computation is done using Compute Shaders and should be fast. However having lots of these will add up\n-- The calculation is done locally for each user - if you want to share it, write the computed value into a field\n-- For Baked probes, the calculation will currently only work with uncompressed texture formats\n-- The Compute Shader is adapted version of this: <https://github.com/pieroaccardi/Unity_SphericalHarmonics_Tools>\n\n- Added OnChanges mode to ReflectionProbe & ChangesSources list\n-- This can be used to have the probe re-render only when another component changes (e.g. a Skybox material)\n-- It's similar mode to Realtime, but it does not re-render constantly - only on changes, saving performance when relevant items do not update\n\n- Add SkyboxOnly mode to ReflectionProbe\n-- This will make the probe render only the skybox and nothing else\n-- It's useful for computing the ambient lighting based on the skybox\n\n- Added auto-upgrade mechanism for worlds, which will convert them to the new lighting system that's managed within the Resonite world\n-- The world is auto-instrumented with a skybox only reflection probe, which is also used to drive the ambient lighting\n-- You can find these components on where the Skybox component is located\n-- This mechanism replicates the old behavior, but with faster update rate (meaning changes in ambient lighting are significantly smoother)\n\n- Added UnpackSH nodes for unpacking spherical harmonics (requested by @reddneko, issue #3585)\n- Added PackSH1 node for packing spherical harmonics of order 1 (requested by @nytra, issue #3542)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Remove \"experimental\" label on PhotonDust\n-- From this point on, we recommend using PhotonDust for any new projects and avoiding the Legacy Particle system, which will be removed very soon\n-- For any changes to PhotonDust we'll now implement compatibility conversions to make sure your items keep working properly\n-- Conversion is still not automatic and legacy particle system is present, but as of now we don't recommend using it for new projects\n-- Legacy system will be removed very soon, so prepare for its removal!\n\n- When particle trails space changes, the trails are now cleared to prevent odd positioning (based on report by brecert, issue #3510)\n\n- Added generic recursion limit for SphericalHarmonics instances that can be introduced into the data model (it cannot be above 2)\n- \"Set Active Skybox\" button on Skybox component is now localizable\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Esperanto locale update by SejdenGrauk\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Russian locale update by @lynrayy \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed the importing of public folders via their resrec url (reported by @badhaloninja, issue #3554, fixed by @probableprime)\n-- This also allows for both Link and Directory record urls to be used to importing public folders and provides error messages on issues/problems with the URL\n\n- Fixed OnChanges reflection probes not re-render when the Slot they're is disabled and then re-activated (reported by @modernballoonie, issue #3553)\n-- This is a `prerelease` build fix\n- Fixed ReflectionProbes breaking when near/far clip are too low\n\n- Fixed deleting PhotonDust particle systems sometimes resulting in all particle systems to break (reported by @modernballoonie, issue #3507)\n- Fixed SkinnedMeshEmitter not working with meshes that either lack bones or blendshapes (based on report by @luxkitty, @nytra, @baxterottoman, @fukuro8232, issue #3522)\n- Fixed GravityForce being in the incorrect space for legacy converted particle systems (reported by brecert, issue #3508)\n- Fixed legacy line emitters not emitting particles with correct direction when using line-aligned mode (reported by brecert, issue #3509)\n-- Note: This is a breaking change for existing converted systems. If you have saved converted systems with PhotonDust with these emitters you'll need to reconvert them\n- Fixed particle renderer modules getting a weird offset when the main renderer space changes (based on report by brecert, issue #3510)\n- Restored the order of operations when importing resdb urls\n-- This fixes cases of \"cloud spawning\" being broken on 2025.1.14.6 (reported by @yoshi1123_, issue #3534)\n-- Do keep in mind that \"cloud spawning\" via this method may break in the future, but we do hope to create an official version of cloud spawning in the future.\n\n- Fixed Spherical Harmonics generic instances not being flagged as unsupported, allowing creating invalid instances which result in a crash (reported by @modernballoonie, issue #3529)\n- Added generic validation to SphericalHarmonics nodes, preventing unsupported instances from being made and causing issues and crashes (based on report by @modernballoonie, issue #3529)",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I got another build for you with a bunch of goodies! Resonite now has a new data primitive - spherical harmonics! This has been added through my side project of adding gaussian splatting support (which will probably be released next week, I'm going to FC this week, so I don't want to push out big things just yet), but it's useful for lots of other stuff (some of which will also appear soon(ish)!). It's a generic primitive and there's a bunch of nodes and components to play with it.\n\nThis build also merges the joining via URL by @probableprime, so that should be significantly improved! \n\nThere's some other goodies by @bluecyro and @ryuvi as well.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added ability for the UniversalImporter to recognize and handle ressession://, and other network protocol links(lnl, lnl-nat) (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This Allows you to paste or otherwise submit to our importer these links and for them to be processed.\n-- By Default, if a link is joinable(session, network etc), or if the link is a world, Resonite will try to Open/join it.\n- Added Import Settings for Session, World and Network Urls (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Allows you to control what happens in the UniversalImporter for Session, World and Network Urls\n--- Open - Instructs Resonite to Open/Join the URL if possible\n--- SpawnInterface - Spawns a world orb in your active world. This is useful for sharing sessions with your friends\n--- SpawnUrl - Spawns a URL interface for the url, this is useful for technical items such as programming ProtoFlux etc.\n- Created go.resonite.com, a micro-site used to easily link other users to your sessions and worlds (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Provides big green join/open button, which triggers the Join By URL flow, mentioned in the fixes section.\n-- Provides alternative connection urls as text, which are useful for ProtoFlux etc.\n-- Fully supports, Open Graph meta-data, allowing the Sessions and worlds to look good across most social media(Blue Sky, Discord etc)\n-- This item resolves issue reported by @nytra, issue #1120\n\n- Added SphericalHarmonicsL1..L4<T> data model primitives\n-- Spherical Harmonics is a primitive that allows efficient encoding of low frequency directional information\n-- T can be any type that supports scaling (float, float3, float4x4, color, colorX...)\n-- Spherical Harmonics are used as a building block for a wide range of applications. Typically used in rendering (e.g. for ambient light or gaussian splats) or audio (ambisonics directional audio)\n-- We'll be adding more components, nodes and systems to work with these as time goes - e.g. methods to compute them from cubemaps\n-- Addition, Subtraction, Scaling and Lerp operations are supported (e.g. you can use the lerp node to interpolate between spherical harmonics)\n\n- Added PackSHx<T> nodes\n-- These nodes let you create a new spherical harmonics instance by packing its coefficients\n\n- Added EvaluateSH<S,T> node\n-- This allows you to evaluate value of spherical harmonic in a given direction provided by a vector from ProtoFlux\n\n- Added ScaleOrdersSHx nodes\n-- These let you individually scale the order bands of a spherical harmonics from lowest to highest\n-- This is useful if you need to lower/amplify the lower/higher frequency bands of the spherical harmonic\n\n- Added IcosphereSH1 to SH4 procedural meshes\n-- These allow modulating the radius & vertex color using spherical harmonics\n-- They can be used for visualizing spherical harmonics, creating procedural effects and education\n\n- Added Added ColorByOrientationDirectionSHx & ColorByVelocityDirectionSHx modules for PhotonDust\n-- These modules allow modulating particles with a color based on spherical harmonics depending on the direction of the particle\n-- The direction is either determined by the particle orientation (using forward vector) or by the direction that the particle is moving in depending on which version of the module you use\n\n- Added ColorByVelocityDirection module for PhotonDust\n-- This modulates the color of the particle based on a reference direction using the particle velocity\n-- This is added to provide a copmlement to existing version of the module which uses the orientation\n\n- Exposed Away Kick & Away Kick interval status through WorldItemInterface & SessionInfoItemInterface (issue #2593, implemented by @ryuvi)\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Optimized IcoSphere calculation by skipping redundant per-vertex operations\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Update Noto fonts to latest versions to support newer characters (based on request by @krzeszny, @amasteramaster, issue #3514)\n-- Note that if you're using a different set of fonts, you might need to update them manually\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Russian locale update by @shadowpanther \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed joining Resonite sessions via URL (requested by business client and reported by @frooxius, @aritosuits, @enverex, issue #1295 and @cyberfrogg, issue #2260, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- On Startup, Resonite will now check that its protocols are registered on your computer, If they are not they will be registered by a small helper program.\n-- Once registered, clicking or visiting any ressession://, resrec://(assuming its a world at the moment) resonite: link from within Common Apps such as Browsers, Email Clients etc. Will prompt you to launch a tiny program.\n-- If the program detects that Resonite is open, it will forward the clicked url, to Resonite.\n--- The URL will then be Imported, by our Importer system. See New Features for info on the changes there.\n-- If the program does not detect Resonite is open\n--- It will attempt to open Resonite via Steam if possible\n--- And then manually, using CLI arguments to launch into the world\n--- In both cases, it will add Command Line Parameters to try to open the URL once Resonite has completed opening.\n-- For more information on these feature checkout our wiki page on it: https://wiki.resonite.com/Go.resonite.com\n-- If you'd like to opt-out of this system you can add `\"disableProtocolRegistration\":true`, to your Config.json file.\n\n- Fixed Color serialization including the IsNaN property\n- Fixed ColorX inspector editor not properly nesting out, corrupting the UI when the colorX datatype is used within other datatypes\n- Fixed ParticleSystem not unregistering style events when destroyed, resulting in resource leak and exceptions (based on report by @modernballoonie, issue #3507)\n- Fixed new gradients added to gradient sky box not appearing (reported by @bluecyro, @spexcat, issue #2514, fixed by @bluecyro)\n",

When PhotonDust moves out of the experimental phase, following will happen:\n- PhotonDust \"experimental\" label will be removed\n- Conversion from Legacy -> PhotonDust will become automatic (it'll always happen)\n- Legacy Particle system will be removed completely\n- This will conclude this part of performance update and allow to move to the next one (audio system)\n\nYou can check the current state of PhotonDust development and the individual issues here: https://github.com/orgs/Yellow-Dog-Man/projects/42/views/1\n\nIt's getting close!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added \"BurstOnStart\" to PhotonDust particle emitters\n-- When this is on, the emitter will burst when it initialy starts (e.g. when loaded or on duplication)\n-- For converted legacy emitters, this is on by default, fixing compatibility issue (reported by @foxbox., @modernballoonie, issue #3495)\n-- The burst only happens if the emitter is Enabled and its slot is Active at the time of the start\n- Added `disablePlatformInterfaces` to the config .json file\n-- When true, platform interfaces like Steam or Discord won't be initialized\n-- This can be useful when you don't want Resonite to interact with those at all, but some functionality will be unavailable\n-- Platform interfaces can also be disabled with `-DisablePlatformInterfaces` command-line without having to modify the config file\n- Added UseSystemLocalRotation to particle style\n-- This will use the local rotation of the particle system as basis, regardless of the simulation space\n-- This fixes legacy particle systems having wrong orientation in some cases (reported by @krzeszny, @joshtiger, issue #3423)\n-- Note that this is breaking change as UseSystemLocalScale & ParticleScaleMode were moved to ParticleStyle as well. You will need to reconvert any existing systems\n- Added DirectionPostTransform to most PhotonDust emitters\n-- These allow you to specify arbitrary 3x3 matrix which will be used to transform the direction/velocity vector after all other transofmrations are done\n-- SphereEmitters converted from legacy systems have an adapter automatically injected to replicate bug of legacy system, where the direction in radial mode is not actually properly transformed. This preserves behavior for old systems (based on report by @krzeszny and @joshtiger, issue #3420)\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Move PhotonDust simulation job processing to TPL processor to separate it out of FrooxEngine's current job scheduler\n- Improve PhotonDust simulation parallel task division to significantly reduce submission times (based on performance reports by @stellanora, @rucio, @garfflesnark, @foxbox. and @stiefeljackal, issue #3401)\n- Added double-buffering to PhotonDust buffer submission to improve throughput when updating the particle system (based on performance reports by @stellanora, @rucio, @garfflesnark, @foxbox. and @stiefeljackal, issue #3401)\n- Implement multithreaded conversion of render data for trails for PhotonDust to improve overall particle update rate\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Added overall FPS tracking to PhotonDust particle systems\n-- This will help with diagnosing overall rate of updates of the particular particle system\n- PhotonDust particle system should now respect locally disabled rendering (e.g. when blocking avatar)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Spanish locale update by Mrdabup\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fix PhotonDust particle systems ignoring skybox/reflection probe reflections (based on report by @baxterottoman, issue #3452)\n- Fix PhotonDust systems that start disabled bursting large amount of particles on their first activation (reported by @orange3134, issue #3391)\n- Fix particle trails not properly inheriting transform scale, when the scaling mode is Continuous for the whole system, while the trails inherit only the starting value (based on report by @ultrawidegamer and @krzeszny, issue #3379)\n- Fix first points in a trail not respecting SizeInheritanceMode when size inheritance is set to continuous\n- Fix transforming scale from one space to another being incorrect and affected by rotations\n-- This fixes particle trails being different scale when the particle and trail space don't match (reported by @orange3134, issue #3382)\n- Fix particle trails having reversed UV's compared to legacy system, leading to discrepancies (based on report by @krzeszny and @joshtiger, issue #3416)\n",

Any saved converted systems will have this broken - you'll need to convert them again or fix them manually\n-- IgnoreTemplateIntensity and IgnoreTemplateRange on ParticleLightsModule were removed as they're not necessary for the new conversion\n- Fix exceptions when disposting PhotonDust particle system due to disposal being performed twice (based on logs by @_deltawolf, @elbrar, @azzurol, @kick_kick, VictorBraga, PhoenixLugia75, horusalpha, issue #3487)\n- Fix MeshEmitter breaking when given a mesh without UV0s (based on report by @lecloutpanda, @3x1t_5tyl3, issue #3436)\n",

It's been great seeing the cool visuals and stuff everyone's been messing with. If you do, please share more!\n\nAlso this update fixes \"performance\" issue that turned out to not really be much of a performance issue at all - a setting didn't convert right, resulting in PhotonDust having to update and render about 10 times the amount of geometry data for a converted system - and thus having \"lower performance\" as result.

      "contents": "PhotonDust, our new particle system and major milestone for the performance upgrade, is now part of the main build! **It is still in \"experimental\" testing phase**, because there are still issues to fix. However, since it's in a stable enough state to play and experiment with, we can continue testing on the main branch!\n\nCurrently it exists alongside the legacy particle system - I still recommend using the old one for stability until we remove the \"experimental\" label from PhotonDust. The goal is to have a more gradual transition to the new system, rather than an abrupt one, so for the time being, you can use both old and new particle systems!\n\nBig thanks to everyone who helped test PhotonDust in the `prerelease` branch and find a number of issues so far: @rockstarraccoon, @epiceaston197, @decoybird, @orange3134, @zozokasu, @rueshejn, @modernballoonie, @moonbase__, @nytra, @mirpasec, @ultrawidegamer, @lexevo, @badhaloninja, @mysticjuniper, @hamocorp, @dustysprinkles, @foolishsnowmew, @aegis_wolf, @qualium and anyone else I missed (I went over the release notes and issues, so sorry if you got missed! >///< - if you got a prerelease issue open that hasn't been addressed yet, you'll be credited as those get fixed up!)\n\nIf you'd like to help us polish PhotonDust, please give a read to the testing and reporting instructions first: https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/discussions/3276\n\n\nI've also went over how PhotonDust works in a recent episode of The Resonance. If you'd like to learn more, watch here: \n[previewyoutube=OnecM48lKnc;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nThere's also some other goodies in this, @probableprime has overhauled the cursor system, which fixes a bunch of sizing inconsistencies and exposes new options to configure cursor sizes! If you find the new defaults too big (or still too small), adjust them in your settings!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Implemented a new in-house modular particle system called PhotonDust (issue #587 - a major milestone of our performance updates)\n\n[b]IMPORTANT:[/b] This is currently in \"experimental\" state, as there are still issues to fix and polish. Be cautious about using it for new projects at this time (until the experimental label goes away)\n- Please play and experiment with it though to help us polish it up some more!\n- You can still use the Legacy Particle system until PhotonDust is polished for stability\n\nCurrently conversion of Legacy Particle systems to PhotonDust is opt-in - go Settings -> Misc -> Debug -> Convert particle systems to PhotonDust\n- [b]WARNING:[/b] Do not overwrite any items/worlds with converted versions! This will bake in any conversion bugs without being able to resolve them\n- Once PhotonDust is fully polished, we will remove the Experimental label, remove the legacy particle system and make conversion fully automatic\n\nPhotonDust has a number of new features:\n- Designed for performance, with multi-threading & semi-asynchronous updates - heavy particle system updates (e.g. complex collisions with the world) will not drop your FPS as much - only the particle system itself will drop its update rate\n- Highly modular - particle initialization, simulation and rendering is handled by modules, instead of a monolithic component - compose the behaviors you want for your particle system! This also makes adding new features and modules much easier in the future!\n- Feature parity with legacy system - any effects supported by the legacy particle system are supported with PhotonDust as well\n\nIt also introduces many new modules and features over the legacy particle system:\n- Split constant / min-max initializers for particle properties (e.g. if you want only a single value, you don't have to set both value to min/max anymore)\n- Linear, Radial, Turbulent (simplex noise) and 3D Texture-based forces for particles\n- Velocity Drag that allows particles to slow down (requested by @alphaneon, issue #3288)\n- Size over lifetime, Size sine multiplier (to create wobble effects) and more\n- Consistent position & rotation coordinate system handling\n- Color by orientation direction, color from Texture 3D, Color over lifetime in HSV space, Color over lifetime from texture\n- Particle trails with unique color/size for each segment of the trails\n- Configurable ribbon splitting - split by time proximity or fixed sequence - you can separate ribbons between groups of particles if there was a gap between the emission \n- Particle lights module supports more light properties\n- Particle trails can now be simulated in any space (independent of the particles themselves), not just world-space\n- Unified emission direction handling and number of new emitter options, such as:\n-- Colors for point emitters (previously requested by @baxterottoman, issue #3138)\n-- Circle orientation for CircleEmitter\n-- Per-point particle direction for LineEmitter\n-- Body/cap emission direction for Cylinder emitter\n-- And a bunch more!\n\n-------------------\n\n- Overhauled interaction cursor management (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Cursors are now configurable in settings, you can control the base size and various multipliers that affect the cursor when interacting with other objects \n-- This fixes cursor size inconsistencies, with cursor being too small in some cases and having poor contrast (reported by @shiftyscales, @probableprime and @frooxius, issue #3124 and a business client)\n-- This foundational work, allows for further Cursor changes in the future, so check the GH for more!\n\n- Added MultiChannelSimplexTexture3D\n-- This allows specifying simplex noise parameters for each of the color channels independently\n-- You can also set Min, Max and Exp values to process the noise\n\n- Added \"AutoAddIgnoreTags\" to aligners \"AutoAddChildren\"\n-- This allows ignoring any children with specific tag from being auto-added\n-- This is initialized by default with \"AUTO_INJECTED\" tag - this tag will be added to some automatically injected children during upgrade process\n-- This fixes PhotonDust upgrade process from breaking some aligners (based on report by @ultrawidegamer and @foolishsnowmew, issue #3329)\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Fixed TrackedDevicePositioner registering setting listener every frame, rather than just once, resulting in performance degradation (reported by @esnya, issue #3351)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Russian locale update by @shadowpanther \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Updated yt-dlp from 2024.12.06 to 2024.12.13\n",

You will need to use the new runtime to host. Our community ran a number of tests and everything seems to be fine. There might be some extra performance boost from this too thanks to improvements in .NET 9 - we did notice them in our cloud infrastructure that got moved to .NET 9 recently too.\n\nThere's new accessibility options too - you can enable controls to look around with your keyboard arrows, instead of just mouse! If you have difficulty using mouse or use remote desktop or laptop with poor touchpad, this should help you!\n\nSome work was done on the cloud as well recently, because we ran into an issue where syncing got stuck. Investigating that revealed a few related problems, which now got fixed up, which should improve the robustness a bit and reduce some load & cost on the cloud.\n\nThere's not much other things, my focus has been mostly on PhotonDust now. Pushing the .NET 9 now frees up the prerelease slot, so I'll try to get PhotonDust testing started soon, so we can test that one out thoroughly and get it out of the door as soon as we can too!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added keyboard look controls (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This allows you to look around using your arrow keys, instead of just mouse\n-- The goal is to improve accessibility and use with laptops & remote desktop connections\n-- You can enable these in settings under controls\n-- When enabled, you can hold the Control key to suppress this (e.g. in order to send the arrow key inputs to anchors and other systems)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Upgraded headless client from .NET 8 to .NET 9\n-- This is mostly runtime change and shouldn't cause any breakage. If you host sessions, you will need to use .NET 9 runtime to run headless servers now\n-- Big thanks to everyone who helped us test this in prerelease: @zangooseoo, @troyBORG, @darbdarb_, @Bredo, @alex_2pi, OrionMoonclaw, @j4.lc, @ModernBalloonie\n-- .NET 9 has a number of performance improvements, which should provide some speedup to the headless over previous .NET 8\n\n- Added additional diagnostics and error handling to the cloud worker to help improve robustness \n-- This should prevent the cloud worker from getting stuck when processing syncing and other tasks (based on report by @rucio and @stiefeljackal, issue #3210)\n\n- Updated yt-dlp from 2024.11.04 to 2024.11.18\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Removed custom system for handling asset trash removals after a month\n-- We now use the R2's lifecycle rules to handle the removal, which is a lot more efficient (note: this system didn't exist at the time, which is why we needed to implement our own custom system for this instead)\n-- This reduces some load on the cloud and latency of some cloud queue processing operations like syncing as well as some cost on our end\n- Removed custom system for handling thumbnail asset removals\n-- Same as above\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- Improved security of SkyFrost.Archive (CloudFlare-side asset API)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged English locale improvements by AwesomeTornado and addition by @nepushiro\n- Merged Russian locale update by @shadowpanther \n- Merged Finnish locale update by @airride91 \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec",

As part of the upgrade, we also moved all related libraries from 8.x.x versions to 9.0.0 - including ones in the graphical client. I'll be making a `prerelease` build of the headless for .NET 9 for testing & prep, so announcement on that coming soon.\n\nYou can also now import BlueSky videos! Just paste a link to a post with video and it will import as video player! \n\nThere's a few other bugfixes as well.\n\nOh also since there's no data model changes, this build is compatible with previous! Only caveat - you'll experience the bugs and BlueSky videos won't load for you if you run on the old one.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added support for importing BlueSky videos (requested by @moonbase__ and @zyro1331, issue #2965)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Switch cloud projects to .NET 9 from .NET 8 (issue #3179)\n- Update packages to from 8.x.x versions to 9.0.0 to match .NET 9 release (this includes System.Text.Json, SignalR libraries and others on the client-side as well)\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed intractable handles on Avatar Creator and Full Body Calibrator resetting position when released (fixed by @bluecyro)\n- Fixed custom tools without a specified name showing the locale string instead of actual default label (reported by @gyztormizirath, @lixquid, @alizardguy, issue #3171)\n- Fixed BlackBodyColorX node disconnecting its inputs and outputs on load (reported by @troyborg, issue #3188, fixed by @bluecyro)\n-- Any already saved instances should load properly now, unless they were re-saved after being disconnected",

This is mostly cleaning up a number of things, as the main focus is currently on the PhotonDust (new particle system), but there's a number of goodies here.\n\nThe locomotion animation system defaults were finally updated! Sorry it took so long. I'd like to give big thanks to @vrbat, @orange3134 and @rhenium_nv whose parameters were used for the new defaults as well as @bluecyro for going through the community tunings and integrating them into Resonite.\n\nWe also now have latest yt-dlp which should fix issues with loading videos as well as new version of Opus, which improves the quality of voice and has much better handling for lost packets!\n\nThere's also a number of bugfixes for several issues as well as some new nodes that should simplify a few things.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added ComposeColorX node\n-- This lets you compose a new colorX value from color and color profile\n- Added ColorXToProfile node\n-- This converts a colorX value to a color value in a specified target color profile\n- Added GetColorXProfile node\n- Added GetColorXBaseColor node\n-- WARNING! This gives you the raw base color in whatever profile it is, with the color profile information removed. You're responsible for maintaining that color profile information externally when you work with these values\n- Added DecomposeColorX node\n-- This gives you both the base color and color \n- Added GetLocomotionArchetype node\n-- This gives you the \"archetype\" (Walk, Fly, NoClip...) of given locomotion node as a nullable enum\n-- Note that some locomotion modules might not have one assigned and the value will be null for them\n\n- Added UniFesta 2024 & VKet 2024 badges (requested by @orange3134 / Weaverse (our partner), implemented by @probableprime)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Replaced default locomotion animation tuning parameters with community based tunings (integration handled by @bluecyro)\n-- The new defaults are a combination of @vrbat 2.2 animations with idle foot turning values from IKANJI 1.08 by @orange3134 and @rhenium_nv\n-- Big thanks to everyone helping us tune these values and improve the animations! \n-- Please note that this only changes the defaults - if you're already using custom settings yourself, the system will use those. If you prefer different animation style, you can always override the defaults \n\n- Updated yt-dlp from 2024.10.07 to 2024.11.04\n- Update opus library (used for encoding voice & audio streams) from 1.3.1 to latest 1.5.2 (issue #3125, huge thanks to @j4.lc for creating CI/CD scripts)\n-- This has a number of improvements for audio quality, optimizations and significantly better handling for packet loss\n-- Our fork is available here: <https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/opus>\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc\n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread \n- Merged British English locale update by @bredo \n- Unified key names for tooltips/tools (based on report by @whippersnatchpumpkinpatch, issue #563 in Locale repo)\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed TwitchChatMessageEvent and TwitchSubscriptionEvent node interfaces not generating properly (reported by @shuisho, @amasteramaster , @nytra, @grand__, o6uipi, UnskilledWolf, issue #2597)\n-- This also fixes not being able to use their CheerBadge & Plan output values in the data model due to not being marked as data model values\n- Fix TwitchChatMessageEvent & TwitchRaidEvent color outputs not being properly upgraded from color to colorX\n-- Existing instances that use color should be auto-upgraded to preserve functionality. If you run into issues with this, please make a report!\n- Fix being unable to switch locomotion modes after a locomotion module is deleted (reported by @jackthefoxotter, @3x1t_5tyl3, issue #3156)\n- Fix record asset manifest getting cleared when changing username (based on report by @shiftyscales, issue #3152)\n-- Added a mechanism to prevent partial entities from being written back to the database to catch similar problems early next time\n- Fixed scrollwheel speed being framerate dependent (e.g. when sliding items) (reported by @bluecyro and @copygirl, issue #2451, fixed by @bluecyro)\n-- This also fixes the Scroll Wheel Grab Move Speed setting not being visible in the settings\n- Fix WAV files with AAC encoded audio data resulting in crash of all users when imported (reported by @ceekur, @waterphox, @applebutter180, @troyborg, issue #3167)\n-- Currently we do not support these types of files\n-- This has been done by removing any Media Foundation based decoders from CSCore library to prevent similar crashes - these decoders are not cross-platform and seem to cause crashes when used in combination with Unity\n",

In most cases you probably wouldn't encounter the problem if the color and the texture are the same color profile. However if this fix results in some of your procedural textures looking incorrect, please make a GitHub issue with report and we'll sort out system to fix those up!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added \"Spawn Visualizer\" to procedural 3D textures in the inspector to allow easily visualizing them\n- Add SimplexTexture3D procedural texture\n-- This generates a procedural 3D texture with simplex noise\n-- You can control the offset/scale of the noise and the two colors it interpolates between\n-- You can also switch it to use 4D SimplexNoise algorithm, with a WOffset - this lets you evolve the noise \"in time\"\n- Added Simplex 4D node overload\n-- This samples a 4D simplex noise function using a float4 coordinate\n- Add ExcludeHeadless to Boolean/NumericUserOverrideGather (requested by @3x1t_5tyl3, issue #3132)\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Hoisted color profile conversions in several procedural textures out of per-pixel operations to only happen once\n-- This should slightly speed up the procedural texture generation, especially for textures with heavy color interpolation math\n- Remove unnecessary color profile overhead when generating UVTexture pixels\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged English locale names for the tools by @rueshejn \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec\n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread, @torrndraws \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n\n[h2]Removals:[/h2]\n- Remove ExternalCameraSeparationPoint component\n-- This is no longer used by any systems and was obsolete\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fix ResonitePackages getting corrupted when overwritten (reported by @989onan, @dustysprinkles, @karasutengu, @epiceaston197, issue #3109)\n- Fix SimplexTexture ignoring the color profile on Background/Foreground inputs instead of converting them to the color profile of the texture\n- Fix SolidColorTexture ignoring the color profile of its input\n- Fix StringQRCodeTexture ignoring color profile on Color0 and Color1 inputs\n- Fix GridTexture ignoring the color profile of BackgroundColor & \n- Fix NoiseTexture ignoring the color profile of MonochromeMin/Max inputs\n- Fix AudioWaveformTexture ignoring color profile of Background/ForegroundColor inputs\n- Fix GradientStripTexture ignoring the color profile on the gradient inputs\n- Fix logs getting spammed with \"Error running discord callbacks: NotRunning\" (reported by @nytra, issue #1522, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fix SteamLink face tracking not initializing after recent update (reported by @modernballoonie, @zahndy, issue #3067)\n-- This would happen if you at any point switched to hand tracking on your Quest headset before launching Resonite\n-- Please note that in order to fix this, SteamLink OSC face tracking is now initialized for any Oculus headset, even when not running over SteamLink. This is due to SteamLink changing the headset identification from SteamLink to Quest 2 (even if Quest 2 isn't used) after hand tracking activation. We're not currently aware of another way to reliably detect SteamLink use\n- Fix Black Body Color node returning colors in the wrong color space (reported by @pjb, issue #1402, fixed by @bluecyro)\n- Fix TimeSpanFromX causing crash when being fed NaN values (reported by @mpmxyz, issue #3081)\n",

I was originally hoping to release this before BLFC, but since there were some issues with the changes that needed to get resolved, it got pushed until now so we can resolve them.\n\nThis is the first build that was made with a new SDK-style project style which @bluecyroand and @geenz switched us to! This doesn't change any functionality on itself, but it makes building Resonite easier by using a more modern pipeline, which saves all coders time and allows us to spend more of it on implementing other things!\n\nThere's a bunch of smaller additions and bugfixes in this as well. This includes fixes to the handling of controllers when switching between controllers and hands with SteamLink. There are still some lingering issues with that, but none of them should be new.\n\nBig thanks to everyone who helped test the updated SteamVR input handling in prerelease to make sure that controller inputs do not break with these fixes: @zahndy, @bigredwolfy, wisemagick1, @rockstarraccoon, @troyborg, @krzeszny, @nytra, Mhowser, @dustysprinkles, @gamethecupdog, @foxobread, ko-tengu, @stellanora, @foxbox., @shdw_x, @siderealscout\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Switched internal project files to more modern SDK style (implemented by @bluecyro and @geenz)\n-- This is an internal change with no functional difference for Resonite itself\n-- It is an important change, because it uses newer tooling for building Resonite and its components, which in turn simplifies the overall development process\n\n- Added notifications when your permission role in the world is changed (requested by @moonbase__, @draconas_rayne, @modernballoonie, issue #3057)\n-- You can configure the notification level (or disable this completely) in the settings under \"User Interface\"\n\n- Exposed 2D versions of Slerp and SlerpWithMagnitude to ProtoFlux (requested by mpmxyz, issue #3010)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Upgraded yt-dlp from 2024.08.06 to 2024.10.07\n- Upgraded SteamVR Unity Plugin from v2.7.3 to 2.8.0 (SDK 1.14.15 -> 2.0.10)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Russian locale update by @shadowpanther\n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fix earmuff transition range not scaling with the user (based on report by @shiftyscales, issue #2230)\n- Fix RelayName network statistic not being correctly populated (reported by @bredo, @zyro1331, issue #2958)\n- Fix Slerp not interpolating properly when the vectors are exactly opposite each other (they will now be slightly biased in the positive dimension)\n- Rebuild bindings whenever the registered controller changes\n-- This fixes changes in active controller resulting in the controls being broken in some cases\n- Fix users with usernames containing slashes and other symbols not being able to be fetched from the cloud API (reported by @mvak, @nepushiro, issue #3085)\n-- This fixes those users not getting assigned proper default roles with headless\n-- Note that this is fixed by using different endpoint internally that makes the username a query: `users?name=<NAME_HERE>&exactMatch=true`\n- Fix ComposeFinger node throwing an exception when given invalid inputs (reported by @modernballoonie, issue #3112)\n-- The node will now return -1 value when the inputs are invalid\n- Fix Resonite controllers not tracking anymore when switching between hand tracking and controllers with SteamLink beta (reported by SilvyPaws, issue #2945)\n-- The SteamVR input handling has been rewritten partly to fix these issues and make controller handling more robust\n-- Note that there are still Unity crashes present when switching between the controllers/hands.

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I got another build for you! This one is more of a \"cleanup\" build, merging in and sorting out some of the issues that have been pushed to backburner for a bit with other stuff we were dealing with. \n\nThere's a bunch of new cool goodies in this one! Lots of new nodes & functions for shaping/easing, more access to the eyebrow tracking data. You can now also mark worlds as \"Readonly\" to prevent accidental saves (e.g. when you archive things).\n\nThere's also important privacy improvement in this one, which builds on the recent session networking handling rework: User's ban status is no longer included in the public API that can be queried by anyone - the information is now only accessible once for brief period when joining a session, which helps improve overall privacy.\n\nA bunch of things were fixed up too - issues with the finger posing system breaking, Resonite to Resonite account migration (this actually borked due to security fortification that was done a while back) and more!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added a set of new easing/shaping functions (issue #736, implemented by @ryuvi)\n-- Following easing functions are now supported: Sine, Quadradic, Cubic, Quartic, Quntic, Exponential, Circular, Rebound (Back), Elastic and Bounce\n-- These are available as Tween CurvePreset property\n-- There are also three ProtoFlux nodes for each - In, Out and InOut\n\n- Added eyebrow drivers to EyeLinearDriver (requested by @hazre, @gourry.gabriev, @natbard, issue #2303, implemented by @ryuvi)\n-- InnerBrowVerticalTarget, InnerBrowRaiseTarget, InnerBrowLowerTarget, OuterBrowVerticalTarget, OuterBrowRaiseTarget, OuterBrowlowerTarget\n- Added InnerBrowVertical & OuterBrowVertical to AvatarRawEye data (requested by @hazre, @gourry.gabriev, @natbard, issue #2303, implemented by @ryuvi)\n\n- Added \"Readonly\" flag for worlds (requested by @stiefeljackal, @rucio, @medravr, issue #2793)\n-- You can set this by editing the world's metadata and checking is \"ReadOnly\" checkbox\n--  When checked, you won't be able to save the world in-place or overwrite it\n-- If you want to make saving the world possible again, uncheck the flag first, before loading the world again\n-- Please note that this is only \"soft\" prevention and not a security/permission mechanism. The goal is to prevent accidental saves (e.g. for archived worlds)\n\n- AppConfig can now restrict which login methods are available with `availableLoginMethods` list property (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Currently Login, Register and SAML are supported login methods\n-- This is useful for coporations/organizations which want to restrict which methods can be used to login\n- Added `forceStartMicrophoneMuted` setting to AppConfig, which allows to override the microphone to always start muted (implemented by @probableprime)\n\n- Bezier Curve node now outputs the tangent in addition to the curve point (implemented by @bluecyro)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- The hyphen symbol \"-\" is now a legal character in dynamic variable path names (requested by @badhaloninja, @gareth48, issue #3038)\n-- This makes it easy to directly use user/group ID's as part of the path\n\n[h2]Privacy:[/h2]\n- Restricted access to user's ban status through the public API (based on feedback by @rucio, @stiefeljackal and @dantetucker, issue #2619)\n-- This prevents anyone from determining whether arbitrary user is currently banned or not just by querying the API\n-- When joining a session, the host is given one-time access key to query the user's ban status. This ensures that the information is available only for a brief period to a single user and only when the user initiates join to a session\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- Improve validation when creating onetime access keys in the API\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fix finger pose processing components breaking when one of the source components only provides rotations with no positions (based on report by @modernballoonie, issue #2964)\n- Added filtering to session update events to prevent local status updates being triggered by irrelevant sessions\n-- This fixes the underlying issue behind \"Session updated, forcing status update\" log spam (reported by CZakarya, issue #2909)\n- Fix regression causing data migration between two Resonite accounts not working (reported by RuiNtD, @tumnusb, @wattlefoxxo, @mvak, issue #2347)\n-- This was caused due to session token security fortification implemented a while back\n- Fixed output of Bezier Curve being wrong (reported by @zozokasu, @rhenium_nv, @orange3134, @rucio, @banane9, ColinTimBarndt, Kemono-Kay, issue #1268, fixed by @bluecyro)\n",

I got a new build for you, with another chunk of performance optimizations - this build fixes the voice/pose hitch when users join sessions, ensuring they stay smooth even when the sessions grow big!\n\nThis has been done by rewriting the session networking handling system, which made the code a lot nicer as well, fixed, optimized and improved a bunch of things along the way and opened more doors towards future improvements as well.\n\nThere are a number of smaller improvements too, regarding moderation and group management.\n\nI'll be traveling tomorrow, so things will probably be busy, but I hope this build helps quite a bit. There's a lot more performance optimizations to be done, especially to improve the overall framerates!\n\nAlso big thanks to everyone who helped test this new update, including: @bredo, @ohzee, @kyuubiyoru, @jackthefoxotter, @orange3134, @readun, @j4.lc, @modernballoonie and @foxbox. !\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- When account restrictions are applied, the user will receive an email in addition to Resonite bot message (implemented by @dantetucker)\n-- This also fixes issue where full account bans (which are very rare) are not able to learn reason for banning through their account\n- `/changeGroupName <group name> <new name>` can now be used by group admins (requested by @zandario, issue #394, implemented by @dantetucker)\n\n- Added mechanism for replacing invalid references in hierarchy to allow upgrading components and nodes with changed structure\n-- This is more of an internal change right now, which will help implement backwards compatibility when upgrading code\n\n- Add Account Deletion command-line tool (requested by @CanadianGIT on behalf of the moderation team)\n-- This allows you to request / cancel account deletion without needing to log into Resonite itself\n-- You will need to provide your login credentials (username & password) to trigger/cancel the deletion\n-- Once activated, the deletion process works the same - there is one week grace period, during which you'll receive emails warning about the impeding account deletion\n-- This tool also works when the account is currently banned, allowing users with account restrictions to remove them\n-- Please note that we do keep minumum information necessary to detect ban evasion even when account is deleted. Deleting your account won't let you bypass the ban and attempting to do so might result in even more severe restrictions\n-- You can find this under \"Tools\" in the Steam installation. It requires .NET 8 runtime to run.\n-- Funny anecode - I implemented this while on a train to Prague\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Reworked session networking handling to remove voice & pose hitches caused by users joining a session (reported by \"literally everyone\", issue #1477)\n-- Processing of incoming/outgoing messages - encoding/decoding and so on is now handled in parallel with the task parallel library\n-- Majority of processing for control messages (initial join, asset transfers) has been hoisted out of the world sync loop, allowing them to be processed faster and reducing overhead on the world loop itself\n-- Improved the security/robustness of the initial handshake when joining session\n-- This is a significant rewrite, which significantly improves the overall quality of the code and makes working with this system much easier in the future and will make fixing bugs, security/privacy issues and adding new features (e.g. mesh networking) much easier\n-- Note that there is still a data model hitch that happens during the initial capture of the world state. This should not affect any voices and user pose streams. Optimizing this is a different set of optimizations in the future.\n\n- Rework synchronization of time from async stream messages to avoid constant memory allocations\n- Rework async stream decoding to reduce memory allocations \n- Optimize building a list of users for sync message transmission\n- Fix freshly joined users receiving host streams when they haven't requested streams yet, causing unecessary overhead\n- Fixed session processing not returning pooled resources, resulting in constant memory allocations and GC pressure\n\n[h2]Tweak:[/h2]\n- World configuration changes will not be logged for userspace and worlds with only the host in them to eliminate clutter (implemented by @probableprime)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed failure message displaying wrong port when starting LNL listener fails (fixed by @probableprime)\n",

There's a number of tweaks which should make it behave and look better and fix some of the weirdness.\n\nI think it's pretty ready to get some of the community made tunings integrated, so if you're helping to fine tune the parameters, give this build a try, I'll be looking at them soon.\n\nThere's also more additions to the footstep system - it's now super easy to setup worlds with footstep sounds! You just need to create footstep sound definitions for various materials - you can select/modulate them based on the foot impact velocity and other parameters and then you just need to apply a single component to the collider surfaces for this to work.\n\nIt works with submeshes (so you can match different sounds to different materials) and there's a component to work with splatmaps too!\n\nThere's still more to do with the system, but this should be adding a bunch more polish and giving you some extra goodies at the side as well!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added FootstepSoundDefinition for defining a single footstep sound \"material\"\n-- You can have multiple clips for each definition, where one is chosen randomly based on the footstep specifics and weight\n-- Each sound can be limited to play only if the footstep impact velocity is within MinVelocity & MaxVelocity - this lets you use different sound effect clips depending on how fast the player is walking/running\n-- Each sound can also be limited to play only for walking on the ground or only when the player lands after falling/jumping. You can also limit clips to play only for the left or right foot\n-- You can modulate the sound pitch and volume based on the velocity and add a random variation to each as well\n-- The idea of this component is that you can easily reuse it for lots of colliders and parts of the world - e.g. by creating a preset for walking on grass, wood, metal and so on\n\n- Added FootstepSoundPlayer component\n-- Place this on any collider that you want to produce sound effects when players walk on them\n-- You can reference one or more \"sound materials\". Use multiple if you want each submesh of a mesh collider to produce a unique sound effect\n-- If only a single material is defined, it will be always used, regardless if the foot lands on a submesh\n-- The sound material component can be individual FootstepSoundDefinition or a component that handles further selection\n\n- Added FootstepSoundSplatmapSplitter\n-- This component is a sound material that can be plugged to FootstepSoundPlayer\n-- It allows you to reference a splatmap and then play appropriate sound effect depending on which part was hit - selecting unique sound effects for R, G, B or A, depending which channel has highest value\n-- The splatmap needs to be a readable texture for this to work\n-- This only works with UV mapped mesh colliders\n\n- Add SelfFootstepEventRelay (requested by @jackthefoxotter, issue #2927)\n-- Placing this in the hierarchy of the user lets you receive all footstep events generated by that user\n-- You can use this directly as the source for the FootstepEvents node\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Add landing velocity to the velocity of a footstep event after falling\n-- This will more accurately represent the impact velocity of the foot on landing\n- Improve forward movement reference handling to be smoother and prevent rapid flipping between front/backwards movement when moving sideways (based on report by @zyro1331, issue #2922)\n- Reworked knee effector calculation to produce better knee poses and avoid the leg randomly twisting around\n-- Note that it can still misbehave when crouching, particularly depending on the avatar and how the IK is configured\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fix locomotion forward reference flipping when looking up\n- Fix LocomotionState not being marked as data model type\n-- This fixes DebugLocomotionSimulator causing crash when added in a session with users (reported by @moonbase__, @draconas_rayne, Orion_Moonclaw, issue #2927)\n- Fix footstep events being missed when landing at high velocity\n",

This allows the environment to receive events whenever player lands a footstep on them. Currently there's mainly a node which gives you the raw event data, so you can do whatever you want with it!\n\nThere will be more components built on top of this, espeically to make it easy to setup footstep sound effects in the world! The system also doesn't detect footsteps from full body movement yet (though when you walk around and the animation system takes over it will get that), but this will be added later too.\n\nThere's a few other small additions. I've also started work on more optimizations (notably the session server join hitch), but that is a bit bigger thing.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Add better body turning detection for locomotion animation while in VR\n-- The hands are used to distinguish from the head moving around vs the whole body moving around - the body will move only if the hands move with it\n\n- Added DeltaAngle(Rad) node which computes angle between two 2D vectors and the direction\n-- Positive angle is clockwise, negative counter-clockwise\n-- Positive Y coordinate is up\n\n- Added a general system for sending footstep events into the world\n-- This can be used by a number of components and systems, with more to come! Right now you get the raw events themselves, I plan on adding a component that will make it easy to setup sound effects for this soon as well!\n-- Currently this only receives footstep events coming from the locomotion simulation - it will not detect footsteps coming from full body tracking (except when simulation takes over when you walk) - this will be added later\n\n- Added FootstepEventRelay component (under Locomotion/Footsteps)\n-- This allows to relay the footstep events to another Slot\n\n- Add FootstepEvents node (under Locomotion)\n-- You need to provide the FootstepEventRelay node as a source\n-- This will locally fire for each user who performs a footstep on the collider the event is sourced from\n-- You will receive the foot side (left/right), position and rotation of the footstep, impact velocity and whether the footstep is from landing (e.g. when falling), the hit collider and hit triangle index (if mesh collider was hit)\n\n- Added FootstepEventDebugVisualizer\n-- This visualizes footstep events received by the collider that this component is on\n-- This is mostly for diagnostic purposes - do not use this to build any specific behaviors!\n\n- Add RelayName network statistic of type string (issue #2751)\n-- When user is connected through a relay, this will be filled with the name of that relay\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Add more detailed logging to world destroy events and ensure events get called even if one of them throws an exception (based on report by @_deltawolf, @zyro1331, @aritosuits, @stiefeljackal, issue #2681)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale tweak by @muppeq\n\n[h2]Removals:[/h2]\n- Remove DebugSetting component since it's no longer needed (based on report by @dustysprinkles, issue #2911)\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fix session asset gather jobs not unregistering world destroyed events, resulting in resource leak and also exceptions when the world is closed after the asset has already been processed (based on report by @_deltawolf, @zyro1331, @aritosuits, @stiefeljackal, issue #2681)\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! Here's a bunch more additions, tweaks, improvements and fixes, majority of them for the locomotion animation system. This should make things look and behave better, but there's still more to do! \n\nIf you're helping us tune the default parameters, I recommend giving the sets a try. Since this auto-computes metrics for avatars, your existing tunings will probably look a bit different and might need re-tuning. Same with some other stuff that changes the behaviors a bit.\n\nThere's a few other additions and improvements too, but still heavily focused on the animations, since that's mostly affecting people now.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Implemented automatic computation of metrics for locomotion animation for full body avatars (issue #2887)\n-- This should overall help animations fit the avatars better and make them look better\n-- Note that with these changes, some re-tuning will probably be needed\n-- This computes feet separation, shoulder positions and arm lengths and hand offsets\n-- Note that the success rate will vary depending on avatar and some avatars might need adjustment more than others. The calculation is based on the resting pose of the avatar - e.g. if the resting pose of the avatar has wide feet stance, the resulting metrics will also produce a wide stance\n\n- Added smarter adjustment of forward reference direction for the locomotion animation to allow to head move without the feet immediately reacting\n-- The head can move up to certain angle before the feet will start adjusting rotation\n-- When walking or running, this adjustment will happen sooner, in order for feet to stay aligned with the direction of movement\n\n- Added system that limits maximum simulation timestep for locomotion animation and will perform multiple simulation steps per frame if it drops too low\n-- This helps improve the accuracy of the simulation, especially at lower framerates\n-- There's a limit to simulation steps. If the framerate is running too low or there's a freeze, the simulation will \"slip\". This is done to prevent too much CPU load by too many simulation steps and also to prevent the simulation from causing a \"freak out\" by stepping too far\n\n- Full body avatars using VRIKAvatar will directly feet current shoulder position into the locomotion animation system\n-- This overrides the actual shoulder separation and offset set by the metrics with live-updated poses, which provides the most accurate results\n\n- Added Space to LocomotionAnimation(Feet/Hand)Metrics\n-- This allows specifying the metrics in the local space of the Slot the component is in, which will automatically rescale them to the user root\n-- This is better when the avatar gets significantly scaled when equipped and ensures the metrics stay in sync with its current scale\n- Added ShoulderOffset metric\n-- This allows applying forwards/backwards offset to the shoulder position\n\n- Added support for universe homes (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This is useful for organizations/corportations, so they can have a custom Local & Cloud home for users in their private universe\n\n[h2]Optimizations:[/h2]\n- Slightly improve environment collider check performance by doing a cheaper check first\n- Improve AvatarUserViewHeadOverride performance by reducing GC pressure and disabling completely while in VR\n-- This could potentially help issue #2895 reported by @ryuvi (I haven't tested if the issue is caused by this)\n- Track requests to recalculate skinned mesh matrices and automatically unflag skinned meshes when nothing is requesting them to be recalculated for every render anymore\n- Small optimization when fetching components of certain type \n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Properly calculate head reference position with neck offset, fixing the shoulders moving down when looking down or up\n- Improve forward reference calculation to prevent the feet direction flipping when looking down\n- Improve knee offset calculation when using simulated poses\n- When a foot acquires footing, it is immediately simulated on the ground for the remainder of current update tick\n-- This improves the accuracy of the simulation, especially with large movement speeds\n- Ensure that the default configuration in the world is non-persistent, so it's properly initialized on every startup\n-- IMPORTANT: You shouldn't modify the version of the component referenced by UserPoserController as default other than for testing purposes. If you want to use custom setup, put an instance of the configuration under your avatar\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged English locale tweak by @stiefeljackal \n- Merged German locale tweaks by @muppeq\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed invalid hand swing parameters corrupting the animation, causing the hands to be pulled towards root (based on report by @Jatsy, issue #2875)\n- Fixed RenderTransformOverride not activating properly when enabled/activated from a disabled/inactive state\n- Fixed world loading indicator showing under the floor and not following head rotation (reported by @bredo, @raidriar796, @conehead1, @ocelot342, @modernballoonie, issue #2855, fixed by @probableprime)\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I've got a bunch of bugfixes and improvements for the new system for you. This should fixup most of the pressing issues and improve some of the behavior.\n\nThere's still more to do, I was trying to get automated avatar metrics calculation into this build, but it wasn't working right with all avatars, so I'll need more time to finish that one up, but I'm getting snoozy, so I don't want it to hold up stuff.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Split VelocitySmoothTime parameter to increase & decrease versions (issue #2885)\n-- This allows the velocity to ramp up much more slowly than it goes back down\n-- This helps resolve some of the jankiness, particularly when the player is moving in small bursts, by not immediately going to a running gait, unless the movement is sustained\n\n- Add LocomotionAnimationBodyCollider component, which is now required for any colliders to be considered for self-collision for the hands (based on report by @memtx, issue #2874)\n-- Existing full body avatars are automatically instrumented with those components\n-- Use IgnoreForLeftHand & IgnoreForRightHand to make corresponding hand ignore those colliders (this is used for hand to not self-collide)\n-- The nearest instance of this component is used, which lets you override which hands get ignored\n-- The LocomotionAnimationColliderBlock is still respected if it's found in the hierarchy between the collider that was hit and the LocomotionAnimationBodyCollider - this lets you mark a chunk of hierarchy for collision and then exclude parts of it\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Finnish locale update by @airride91\n- Merged English locale fixes by @airride91\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed duplicate avatar object slots for feet when using full body tracking, resulting in misbehavior\n-- This fixes the tracker visuals being visible even when the tracker is calibrated (reported by @charizmare, @hamocorp , issue #2856)\n- Fix LocomotionAnimationColliderBlock not being properly categorized (reported by @_deltawolf, issue #2868)\n- Fix feet not being positioned properly in avatar anchors (reported by @yoshi1123_, @bluetera, @nexus15., SilvyPaws, @wolf_seisenbacher, issue #2859)\n-- AvatarPoseBoxConstraint now has \"ProcessSimulatedPoses\", which allows you to keep simulated poses when user is in anchor. By default this is off to simulate old behavior.\n- Fix full body calibrator freaking out when adjusting poses (reported by @hamocorp, @harumaki021, issue #2864)\n- Fix CurrentOnGround not updating on VRIKAvatar (reported by @gearbell, issue #2860)\n- Fix held objects moving with head animation (reported by @hamocorp, issue #2858)\n- Fixed newly registered users sometimes getting a blank dash (reported by @kodeska, fixed by @probableprime)\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I've got a build for your after a while. \n\nThis one took a bit, because I spent a lot of time working on the new procedural locomotion animation system, which came up as a requirement for one of our business client. My goal was to get it as good as possible before release, but I've been getting progressively more fatigued with it, making it hard to make progress, but also because it already got merged internally, it was blocking releasing any builds.\n\nBecause of that, I'm releasing this in its current state - it should be polished enough to be better than the existing animations and any major bugs and issues should be sorted out. However the animations themselves aren't as tight and tuned as I'd like them to be, which means they can look a bit goofy.\n\nFortunatelly the system is highly configurable and we've had a number of dedicated community members helping fine tune the default parameters. This will continue to help make the default animations look better and if you're like to nab any of these tunings and use them right now or even contribute to the process, go here: https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/discussions/2799\n\nThere are other additions as well that you can use right away - there's a new set of components for animating fingers! You can use those to setup custom finger pose systems and smoothly blend between those and the finger tracking solutions on the avatar.\n\nA lot of things got fixed up and tweaked too. This build also contains significant improvements to our universe system, which is very useful for corporations and organizations - but some of them can be useful for you as well. Overall these help make Resonite a more well rounded solution for those, which helps support our team.\n\nI'll be focusing on a few issues that have been piling up and some other stuff I wanted to do for a bit in the new few builds, before I circle back and integrate some of the polish for the animations. \n\nAlso big thanks to everyone who participated so far helping test and fine tune the procedural animations: @troyborg, @gamethecupdog, @foolishsnowmew, @shiftyscales, @orange3134, @cameron5, @vrbat, @modernballoonie, @rockstarraccoon, @rabbuttz, @veercollie, @modernballoonie, @j4.lc, @zyro1331 and others (sorry if I missed your name, I'm compiling this from the GitHub issues & discussion - make sure to submit anything there!)\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Implemented a new procedural animation system for animating avatar feet, hands and head when they are not tracked\n-- This sytem simulates the end feet and hand positions as well as head offsets and finger poses\n-- The system uses semi-physical simulation, reacting to user's movement in world\n-- Multiple gaits are supported - animation parameters are interpolated depending on user's speed\n-- The system supports self-collisions of hands with body\n-- The system also supports feet colliding with the environment\n-- When in full body, the system will only override feet when moving fast enough and when you're not horizontal - the horizontal angle can be configured in Settings under \"Controls -> Full Body Tracking\"\n-- IMPORTANT: This system still needs a number of tweaking and fine tuning - which you can contribute to as well\n\n- Added LocomotionAnimationConfiguration (under Users/Common Avatar System/Animation)\n-- This allows you to provide your own configuration for how the procedural animation looks by placing it on your avatar\n-- If this component is absent, world's default configuration will be used instead\n\n- Added LocomotionAnimationFeetMetrics and LocomotionAnimationHandMetrics (under Users/Common Avatar System/Animation)\n-- These allow overriding poses and distances of hands and feet on an avatar to make the animations better fit the avatar\n-- It's useful if the avatar has less typical proportions - short/long arms or legs\n\n- Added LocomotionAnimationColliderBlock (under Users/Common Avatar System/Animation)\n-- Add this to the top of the hierarchy of any colliders on your avatar that you don't want your avatar hands colliding with\n-- You can also add this to the environment colliders, if you want the feet to ignore and not collide with them\n\n- Added LocomotionAnimationSuppressor (under Users/Common Avatar System/Animation)\n-- Placing this on avatar and enabling SuppressFeetSimulation will stop the animation system from taking control over the feet, allowing systems like posers to work\n-- **IMPORTANT:** Please note that generally we advise against hijaking systems you don't control for your own functionality - the way a system controls something can change, breaking your own systems that might depend on particular behavior or pattern of control! (see: <https://wiki.resonite.com/Things_to_Avoid>)\n\n- Added \"Supress Feet Simulation\" setting under Misc -> Legacy Feature Settings\n-- Enabling this will supress the feet simulation, allowing systems like posers to take control\n-- Note that this is only meant to be enabled when you want to use such systems - it will make the body animations look incorrect\n\n- Added AvatarUserViewHeadOverride\n-- This automatically sets up and controls RenderTransformOverride to ensure that any head bobbing animations are not visible while in first person mode\n\n- Added FingerReferencePoseSource which provides a finger pose based on an in-world reference skeleton\n-- This can be used as a basis to build custom finger posing systems, combined with the additional components below (based on requests by @airride91, @jackthefoxotter, @stellanora, InconsolableCellist, @the_furf_of_july, @beethoven__, issues #42, #935 and #1307)\n-- To ease creating of poses, the inspector actions provide several methods to capture existing poses\n-- You can capture a pose from a pose source\n-- You can also capture your current left or right hand pose - this lets you make a pose with your controller or finger tracking solution\n-- This will automatically create necessary skeleton for capture, which you can then modify\n-- Note that the skeleton MUST use the coordinate conventions of Resonite's input system, you cannot use arbitrary skeleton\n\n- Added FingerPoseLerp\n-- This will accept to finger poses sources as input and compute a new pose that's a blend between them\n- Added FingerPoseMultiplexer\n-- This allows you to switch between multiple sources of finger poses\n-- When switching to a different pose, the poses are briefly interpolated during transition\n- Added FingerPoseModifier\n-- This accepst a finger pose as source and will offset the poses of individual fingers\n-- You can offset the curl/splay of individual fingers on the hand\n- Added FingerSplayModifier\n-- This accepts a finger pose source and will modify the global splay of the fingers\n-- You can use this to essentially make the fingers more spread apart or closer together\n- Added FingerPosePreset\n-- This provides common finger pose presets for easy development and testing\n-- Currently Idle, Fist and Point presets are added. More can be added in the future\n\n- Improved Universe support for corporations and other organizations (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Universes can have a primary group associated with them\n-- Users within an universe are automaticlaly added to the universe's primary group\n-- Added UniverseStatus component, which allows accessing details of the current universe\n-- Universes can now add their own overrides to locale\n-- Universes can have their own default homes, dashes\n-- Universes can have their own branding, enabling whitelabel support\n\n- Added global locale arguments that can be used in any locale string (based on locale work by @airride91, PR #753 in Locale, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Currently supported arguments are appName, supportUrl and moderationUrl\n\n- You can now hold X to align your vertical axis in desktop while in three axis locomotion mode (implemented by @probableprime, requested by Spacerocket1)\n- Added \"ZOOM FOV when sprinting\" setting (requested by @terpyderp32, issue #2163, implemented by @probableprime)\n\n- Automatically started sessions can now wait for user to login before they're started (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- Add `\"waitForLogin\": true` to the entry for the world\n\n- Added \"Normalize\" field action to vector fields\n-- This will normalize the vector\n\n- Added support for inspector section headers to help readability for components with lots of properties\n-- Note that only a few use this right now, we'll have to do a pass over components with lots of fields to help split them up\n\n- Added `-FastCompatibility` arguments\n-- This speeds up startup when compatibility hashes are not computed for assemblies\n-- This is only useful for development, because the build will not be compatible with any other build (even another instance of itself)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc \n- Merged Spanish locale update by @ruzeh \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Ukrainian locale update by @antonneposeda \n- Merged Russian locale update by @shadowpanther \n- Merged English locale fixes by @_deltawolf and @muppeq\n- Merged Thai locale update by @naborisk \n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Exiting Resonite while in universe (used for business / education) will now use blank void rather than local (implemeneted by @probableprime)\n- When custom inspector UI builder throws an exception, it will be displayed in the generated UI if possible to indicate that something went wrong, rather than showing incomplete UI\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed new world dialog issues when LNL ports are restricted by config (fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed Replace First Substring node not behaving correctly (reported by @mpmxyz, issue #2550, fixed by @bluecyro)\n- Fixed loading indicator now showing the world name in some cases (reported by @zyro1331, issue #2284, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Ensure access level is provided to local/cloud home as soon as possible, to avoid it being briefly public (reported by @dantetucker, issue #448, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed Pow operation on quaternions sometimes returning NaN\n- Fixed VRIKAvatar using wrong side offset for left foot position\n- Fixed render overrides sometimes not overriding properly due to no render context switches\n- Fixed BipedRig wrongly indicating if right hand fingers were detected\n- Fixed floating point editor fields producing NaN values when the field is empty\n- Fixed finger pose streams missing pinky tip bodynode\n",

The old .NET Framework / Mono headless is gone and the .NET 8.0 is now in its place! You'll need to update your tooling accordingly.\n\nThank you everyone for testing! We've got lots of reports of great performance improvements with .NET 8.0, which is very exciting for the upcoming switch of graphical client to this runtime as well.\n\nThere's also new notification sound effects!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added new notification sound effects for Sociable, User Join & Leave (requested by @epiceaston197, issues #2177 and #1926, sounds made by @lacydoes)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Removed .NET Framework / Mono headless and made the .NET 8.0 version the main (and only) headless client\n-- You can find migration instructions at Wiki here: https://wiki.resonite.com/Headless_Server_Software/Migration\n-- Important: The .NET 8.0 version is now placed in the same folder where the old headless was.

I will be blocking previous builds from accessing the cloud since they're tripping the issues. I apologize for the ping, but this is important to get things stable as soon as possible.\n\nThe gist of things that have been happening is:\n- There's a bug in an old System.Net.Websockets implementation in Mono, where messages that contain multi-codepoint UTF8 symbols (e.g. Japanese or Chinese characters) will trip up validation and make the connection explode and disconnect\n- This bug in System.Net.Websockets was fixed back in 2018, but the Mono implementation in Unity is older than that. I've backported the fix to an older version, which will work for now\n- There has been an increase in session updates with those symbols present, resulting in the connections exploding much more frequently (most of them not lasting even a minute)\n- SignalR would reconnect after connection exploded, which is somewhat heavy process. Due to this happening very frequently for pretty much everyone, this would destabilize the cloud\n- The connection dropping frequently also means that you stop receiving and sending updates randomly, causing further issues with the info being up to date\n\nI'll keep monitoring the situation, but hopefully this should make things calm down.\n\n[h2]Bugfixes:[/h2]\n- Switch to modified System.Net.Websockets implementation for SignalR\n-- This version contains a packported fix for when WebSocket messages end up splitting UTF8 strings in a middle of a surrogate pair, resulting in websocket connection crash\n-- See <https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/26240> for details\n- Ensure that user agent includes Resonite version number\n-- This will help us with cloud diagnostics and potential filtering in case of issues\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! Today build is very heavily focused on improving networking. We've been pretty busy sorting out issues for some of our business uses, which pretty much took all day yesterday to get finished (and I mean... ALL day), so today I only had the energy to polish it up and not do much else >///> \n\nA number of those improvements should benefit overall by improving the robustness of connections and offering some new options - notably Resonite now supports session connections over TCP protocol! This is mostly useful within local and corporate/university networks - but it can be pretty beneficial if you're running connections on LAN - TCP is very fast there.\n\nThe other big addition is \"LNL Poking\" mechanism - this is useful within networks with stateful firewalls, which makes connections work reliably on those networks.\n\nWith this stuff out of the way, we'll have more \"regular\" stuff soon!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added support for TCP protocols for realtime session networking\n-- This will generally only work on direct IP connections on local networks\n-- This is mostly meant as fallback solution for university and corporate networks, when UDP connections fail\n-- However this can be useful for LAN as well, as TCP can perform better on local networks than UDP based protocols\n-- This protocol will also respect the port range setting when configured\n\n- Added Prefer TCP setting to Realtime Networking Settings\n-- Enabling this will prefer TCP connections above all else. This is mostly useful for LAN connections\n-- TCP can perform very well on LAN networks, achieving high transfer speeds\n-- It can also work on certain networks, where UDP traffic is not acceptable\n-- However it can also suffer from head-of-line blocking, causing voices and poses to be significantly delayed, so use this with caution\n\n- Add LNL Poking mechanism to help connections within corporate & university networks\n-- When used within a private Universe, direct LNL IP connections will send \"poke messages\" to the connecting client to help facilitate connection\n-- This helps establishing connections when a stateful firewall is present\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- When announcing local IP's, link-local addresses are filtered out (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- These usually do not work past the first router/switch and in corporate scenarios\n-- This helps speed up connections in some cases by not trying these addresses\n- Add additional logging for LNL connections (including when they start on a restricted port range)\n- Direct LNL connections will now attempt to be established with UDP routing disabled first, which can help in some networks, particularly with multiple network adapters\n-- If this fails, another attempt will be made with the routing enabled afterwards\n-- This should help improve robustness of establishing connections, particularly in corporate/university subnets\n- LNL Listeners & Connections will now manually bind to specific interfaces\n-- This can potentially help resolve some networking issues, when multiple network interfaces are present and wrong ones are being used for routing connections\n- LNL Direct IP connections now indicate the source and target IP/port they're connecting to\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc and @linki9s7 \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged British English locale update by @nytra \n- Merged English locale fix by @muppeq \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq\n- Merged French locale update by @cerealbowlsystem and @j4.lc\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n\n[h2]Bugfixes:[/h2]\n- Improved robustness of Local IP discovery to ensure that all of them are properly discovered\n- Fixed null reference exception in ContactDialog when selecting contacts in some cases (fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed null reference exception for LegacyGlowCircle (fixed by @probableprime)\n",

This is a major rework of how Resonite (FrooxEngine) handles types, improving compatibility and security.\n\nThis is also first major task completed for our performance optimizations - while this doesn't help with performance itself, it lays important groundwork for it. The next step will be moving the headless to modern .NET runtime, which might be relatively simple at this point, since this was a major blocker.\n\nI'd also like to give big thanks to everyone who helped test this and get this polished before public release: @bredo, @epiceaston197, @modernballoonie, @whippersnatchpumpkinpatch, @zyro1331, @bluecyro, @jgullberg, @mpmxyz, @_deltawolf, @aritosuits, @stiefeljackal, @ohzee \n\nAlso since I forgot this in a rush yesterday (sorry ;_;), there's also big thanks to people who helped to test the LNL Windows Size pre-release as well: @ohzee, @bredo and @_deltawolf (and everyone who joined the BoTC game to help test), as well as @rucio, @stiefeljackal, @stellanora, @sveken, @banane9, @jackthefoxotter, iamgreaser, @_deltawolf, PJB3005, @charizmare in issue #1324 from which the work on dynamic LNL window size stemmed based on their testing data.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Redesigned & reworked type serialization & negotiation - introducing a new \"Type Management\" system (issue #2264)\n-- The process of encoding & decoding datatypes, both on network and for persistence, is now fully controlled by our code, rather than relying on .NET Framework methods\n-- This is major step towards moving Resonite & FrooxEngine to modern .NET runtime for performance optimizations, allowing the modern runtime to load existing content and communicate with clients on the old while we transition\n-- This also improves security by restricting which datatypes can be introduced into the data model - specifically marked types can be introduced (e.g. this fixes headless crashes when creating fields of datatypes only found in the graphical client, but not headless)\n-- Generic types are handled recursively - both the generic definition and all the generic arguments need to be allowed data model types to be allowed in the data model\n-- Compatibility between sessions is now computed automatically, which fixes cases where human error (meaning I forget to mark the builds as incompatible) leads to crashes when incompatible builds try to interact (Note: There's still some additional validation that needs to be added)\n-- When saving items, datatypes are now encoded more efficiently into a table, rather than duplicated, speeding up saving/loading process and reducing the file size\n-- This also simplifies maintaining backward compatibility with content, providing more powerful mechanisms to indicate relocated or restructured types\n-- Compatibility is now computed on per-session basis. Each session determines which assemblies (and which versions) it loads. This allows plugins to be loaded without breaking compatibility with vanilla sessions. Note: There's currently no UI for picking which plugins will be available in the session, this will be added later\n-- Note: Plugins now need to be tagged with DataModelAssembly attribute to be scanned for types\n\n[b]IMPORTANT:[/b] Anything you save with this build will not be able to be loaded in older builds.\nIf you find any broken content that doesn't load properly, DO NOT RE-SAVE it (copies are okay) and make a report! We'll have a look asap.\n\n- Nice type parser robustness has been significantly improved (e.g. when specifying type fields or generic arguments)\n-- It now scans all types allowed in the session and allows ambigious matching - you don't need to specify namespace for any types. However if there are name collisions, this might give you the wrong type\n-- Generic & nested types are fully supported in any combination and with any depth\n- Nice type formatting robustness was also significantly improved\n-- Generics, nested types, nullables, arrays and any combinations of these will be properly formatted now\n\n- Added encoding/decoding for quantity types, allowing them to be used as values in the data model (based on report by @_deltawolf, @aritosuits and @stiefeljackal, issue #2527)\n\n- Added `void` type alias when parsing types\n\n- Added Wavelength Color nodes that provide a colorX value corresponding to given wavelength of light (requested by @shdw_x, issue #2406, implemented by @ryuvi and @bluecyro)\n-- The algorithm implemented to compute the color is based on <https://www.baeldung.com/cs/rgb-color-light-frequency#2-cie-color-matching>\n- Added Factorial nodes (requested by @fukuro8232, issue #1688, implemented by @bluecyro)\n-- Variants that output float & double are provided\n-- Trying to compute factorial for negative values will produce NaN\n\n- Added -NeverSaveSettings and -NeverSaveDash launch arguments to prevent settings/dash from being saved on the build\n-- This is particularly useful for testing purposes to not end up corrupting / breaking these\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I've got a build for you today! I've been trying to get the new type management system done, but it needs more time - maybe tomorrow!\n\nHowever there's a bunch of goodies in this one too! There's new LNL Window Size setting, which helps you control the throughput of the LNL library! If you end up queuing packets in a session, increasing this can help! Be careful though, setting it too high can also make things worse.\n\nThis is the first phase of improving the LNL library - the goal is for this value to adjust itself automatically in the future, but that requires additional work. This should make things better in the meanwhile. There's been some more efficiency improvements to LNL as well (something I call \"packet stuffing\"), which help reduce queuing even with the default as well.\n\nNot all LNL bridges & relays are spun up for the new version yet - we'll spin them up in the following days and remove the old versions to help with transition.\n\nYou can now also configure the port range that LNL will use as well! This can be useful if you need to configure your network/firewalls. It can be particularly helpful at university/corporate networks too!\n\nThere's a number of other fixes and tweaks as well, including @dantetucker's first contribution!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added \"LNL Window Size\" setting, which allows controlling the size of LNL window used for networking\n-- If you begin to experience packet queuing in a session, you can increase this value to improve bandwidth and reduce or eliminate queuing\n-- The higher you set the value, the higher the chance of destabilizing the connection! Be careful with this. If the situation worsens - e.g. you start queuing even more or voice starts breaking up, lower it back down.\n-- Changed values will take effect near immediately - you do not need to exit and join the session\n\n- Implemented \"packet stuffing\" into LNL library\n-- This will pad remaining space in packets to be sent out with reliable packet data if they fit, even beyond the window size\n-- This helps improve networking efficiency even with default window size and therefore eliminate more cases of packet queuing\n\n- Implemented port range support for LNL connections, bridges & relays (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This allows restricting the range of ports on which connections will be made\n-- This helps particularly with corporate/university networks, which need to configure their firewalls\n-- You can specify this by adding `lnlConfig` to the Config.json file, with `ports` property, which has `min` and `max` - documentation will be on Wiki at some point\n\n- Exposed Widen parameter on AvatarRawEyeData (implemented by @ryuvi)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Export filenames are now validated, preventing exporting when there are invalid characters (based on report by @chundelac, ko-tengu, yoshiyoshyosh, issue #2286, implemented by @dantetucker)\n-- RTF tags are now also automaticlaly stripped when dialog is opened\n- Updated yt-dlp to 2024.07.09 (requested by @azavit and @gawdl3y, issue #2471)\n-- This should fix instances of videos not loading properly\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq\n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc\n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Improved SignalR connectivity when using web proxies (implemented by @probableprime)\n-- When proxy is enabled, the connectivity automatically switches to LongPolling, due to WebSocket issues when proxy is active\n-- Fixed SignalR getting inconsistent proxy settings from rest of the API's\n- Fixed wrong label for common generic types on component selector (reported by @banane9, issue #2486, fixed by @bluecyro)\n- Fixed ReplaceFirstSubstring throwing exception and causing world crash when index is out of bounds (reported by @ultrawidegamer, issue #1659, fixed by @bluecyro)",

(see each contribution for credit)\n\nAnd also community contribution to an open source library that we use that fixes the scrambled blendshape order from @luxkitty! Thank you so much!\n\nThere are some changes and improvements for networking, which should help when running Resonite on corporate/university networks. It's probably not too interesting to everyone here, but it helps with some of our other usages!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added support for announcing all available local IP's for hosted sessions via session API\n-- This improves direct connectivity within organizational networks, like corporations & universities\n-- This is automatically enabled when UniverseId is set\n-- Alternatively this can be forcefully enabled or disabled via Config.json file by adding `announceLocalIPs` bool? entry\n\n- Add `disableIntroTutorial` setting to Config.json \n-- This will ensure that the intro tutorial (the initial setup wizard and intro world) are never loaded\n- Add `disableCloudHomeAutoLoad` setting to Config.json\n-- This will forcefully disable automatic loading of the cloud home on login\n-- This overrides other settings - e.g. even if user has autoload enabled in their personal settings, this will override that\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- Fixed raw files outside of Resonite's database getting cleaned up on import (reported by TheAutopilot, security ticket #292298, fixed by @probableprime)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Grab spheres in edit mode are more visible now (requested by @alizardguy, issue #1318, tweaked by @ryuvi)\n- Added space at the end of moderation warning message (requested by moderation team, implemented by @probableprime)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Polish locale update by @foxobread\n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq\n- Merged English locale additions and tweaks by @stiefeljackal\n-- Note: Part of is for upcoming feature on prerelease branch and won't be visible on main build until the feature itself is merged\n- Merged Japanese locale tweaks by ginjake\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed Short form ColorX to Hex Code not working correctly (reported by @imerin., issue #384, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed ChildParentAudioClipPlayer not cleaning up slot events, resulting in a world crash (reported by @marsmaantje and @elektrospy, issue #1420, fixed by @ryuvi)\n- Fixed connecting to sessions through LNL getting stuck when a network error occurs during the initial connection\n- Refactored HTTP proxy setup to handle a number of edge cases, causing proxy issues (implemented by @probableprime)\n- Fixed ChildIndex node throwing an exceception on the RootSlot, resulting in a crash (reported by @art0007i, issue #651, fixed by @bluecyro)\n-- The node now returns -1 for RootSlot, as it's not a child of any other slots\n- Fixed regression in Xiexe material blooming more strongly than before with overdriven colors (reported by @epiceaston197, @knackrack, @nepushiro, @shrikealvaron, ko-tengu, issue #2395, fixed by @geenz)\n-- Additionaly this fixes legacy content that was not re-saved not blooming strongly enough (this part was fixed by myself)\n- Voice message recording no longer gets interrupted when the laser leaves the button (reported by @troyborg, issue #142, fixed by @ryuvi)\n- Merged fix for the Assimp library scrambling order of blendshapes on FBX files (reported by @zangooseoo, @gunnar0, @gearbell, @kirvgoldblade, @flamesoulis, @modernballoonie, issue #1106, fixed by @luxkitty)\n-- PR with fix from @luxkitty for reference: <https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/assimp/pull/1>\n",

Plus I'll be travelling tomorrow to Vienna for a business trip and need to do a bunch of preparations for it - I won't be back until late Friday, so there might not be any more builds this week.\n\nHowever I didn't want these bugfixes to get held up, so here they are!\n\nThe build is compatible with previous.\n\nHowever if you don't update, GridTexture will be broken for you with invalid parameters, while it'll work for people with updated builds - this is not really critical, so it's just headsup so you're not confused.\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec\n- Merged Russian locale update by @shadowpanther\n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Fixed GridTexture breaking when invalid parameters are entered (reported by @scrapsavage, @shdw_x, issue #2299, fixed by @bluecyro)\n- Fix data feed views failing to unregister event listeners from the source feed (based on report by @art0007i, issue #2399)\n-- This fixes feed views breaking when the feed is changed to something else (e.g. null) and then back\n-- This fixes resource leak and other potential misbehaving when swapping feeds\n- Fixed VR controls not falling back to turn & move properly when one of the joysticks is set to \"Turn Only\" and other to \"Strafe\" (based on report by ko-tengu, @epiceaston197, xavion-lux, @shiftyscales and @stellanora, issue #2309)\n",

      "contents": "Hello everyone! I'm back and I've got a big update for you! :D\n\nThere's now a Worlds Data Feed! This data feed provides the currently opened worlds and sessions, with filtering & searching options. This allows to build custom world/session viewers/facets and other stuff. In the future, we'll also add support for enumerating saved/published worlds to this feed, so this will be used to rework the World UI.\n\nIn order to support this, the general data feed mechanisms got improved and expanded! They support updating items now (e.g. if you have interfaces, it will automatically update everything with new data - e.g. when a world name/thumbnail/user count/etc changes) and the add/update/remove events support search parameter now.\n\nWe now also have a new Translator badge for everyone who's been helping translate Resonite into other languages and make it more accessible!\n\nThere's lots of other updates too! Plenty of bugfixes by @probableprime and merged shader update by @geenz, which should fix a number of issues with materials/shaders!\n\nAlso please note that SSL 3, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols have been deprecated in this build! We haven't found any issues in pre-release testing. Generally it's recommended to not use those protocols anymore, because they have severe security issues. If you have an issue and you can't switch to a newer one easily, let us know and we'll have a look at what we can do.\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Added Worlds Data Feed (requested by myself (@frooxius) and content team, issue #2300)\n-- This provides a feed of all found sessions and opened worlds\n-- This fully supports events - any data feed items will be added/updated/removed appropriatelly as the world/session info changes\n-- This also supports searching, with simple syntax of `+` for required terms (all must appear) and `-` for excluded terms (none can appear) and plain for optional terms (any of them will make item appear)\n-- A number of filtering options are available: Headless/User hosts, Minimum Total Users/Contacts (for sessions), Min/Max session access level, Min/Max uptime (in seconds)\n-- Found entries can be merged by world ID or session ID - any worlds & sessions with same world or session ID (in this order) will be merged into a single feed item when those merging options are enabled\n-- This can be used to build custom session viewers or facet to show active worlds and so on\n-- Note that any non-public sessions (and any world data) will only be accessible in Userspace or Unsafe worlds for security/privacy reasons\n-- In the future, this will fully replace the WorldListManager, once we have more data feed views and support for published/uploaded world listing is added\n\n- Added MergedWorldDataItemInterface\n-- This provides interface for data feed items from the WorldsDataFeed\n-- This provides data on the aggregate information about the given worlds/sessions\n-- This also provides a data on the individual sessions & locally opened worlds through \"subfeeds\"\n-- Subfeeds allow you to specify template (same as main data feed) and root - it will automatically manage the items for you (add/update/remove) as the information is updated\n-- Each subfeed allow you to configure limit of items you want to show (including 0, which will not generate the items). This limit can be adjusted dynamically - e.g. from 0 to max value, when you want to actually generate the templates - the last data is cached and the items will be generated immediatelly from the template\n\n- Added SessionInfoItemInterface\n-- This provides interface for the SessionInfo data feed items (currently only available through the subfeed on MergedWorldDataItemInterface)\n- Added WorldItemInterface\n-- This provides interface for World data feed items (meaning currently opened worlds, similarly this is only available through the subfeed on MergedWorldDataItemInterface at the moment)\n-- If you're missing some information about the world that you'd like exposed through this, let us know (through a GitHub issue) and we can look if it's possible to add!\n\n- Data Feed events are now \"search phrase\" aware\n-- This means that when search phrase is active, any added/updated/removed items are properly filtered based on the current search phrase\n-- This fixes WorldUsersFeed adding newly joined users that do not match the current search phrase\n\n- Added mechanism which allows data feeds to have persistent data for each view\n-- This allows implementation of new complex features and efficient caching (e.g. for the merging support for the Worlds Data Feed)\n- Added support for updating data feed items with updated data - any generated items will automatically be updated with new data through the same interface (there's no need to make any changes, unless you have mechanism that removes the feed item interface)\n\n- Added a number of activation modes to BooleanSwitcher to provide more flexibility (based on request by @mpmxyz, issue #2269)\n-- AtIndexOnly (this is the original mode, activates item only at the index)\n-- AllButIndex (the item at index is deactivated)\n-- IndexAndBefore (all items all the way to the index are activated)\n-- IndexAndAfter (all items at index and after it are activated)\n\n- Added Translator badge (requested by modimobeikete, issue #1814, badge created by @chromashiba)\n-- If you've been contributing translations and gotten reward space for it, you should get the badge automatically within next few hours\n-- If you don't have one, please make an Issue at the Locale repo and we'll try to get to it as soon as possible!\n\n- Added `debugWorldState` command to headless, which prints out debugging info for state of all worlds (this is to help diagnose issue reported by @j4.lc, @readun, @hikari_akimori, @ink_25, issue #685)\n-- If the session freezes your headless, type this command and save the output. Then type it again a few seconds later and save the output again.\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- `.cc` extension is now recognized as a text file on import (requested by RobertBaruch, issue #1030, implemented by @probableprime)\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- Fixed user invisible status leaking when signing out (reported by @989onan via security ticket #788915)\n- Added moderation tool for sending warnings to users (requested by @veercollie internally, implemented by @probableprime)\n-- This can be used by any moderators to issue official warnings\n-- There is built-in audit, which informs moderation leads when warnings are issued to prevent any potential abuse of this command\n\n- SSL 3, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols have been now deprecated (implemented by @geenz)\n-- If you run into issues with this, please let us know ASAP and we can revert this. However please note that this will eventually go away completely anyway, because in modern versions of .NET these protocols are not supported at all. You should upgrade to latest TLS, since these older versions have severe security issues\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged migrated Metric/Imperial locale strings for all languages from the legacy strings by @stiefeljackal \n- Merged missign English keys for inspector texture (fixed by @stiefeljackal)\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc and @zozokasu \n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc\n- Merged British English locale update by @paradoxical_autumn \n\n[h2]Fixes:[/h2]\n- Light Tool \"Change Color\" context menu item now uses the locale key (reported by @namminamm, issue #483, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed spelling in Impulse Receiver Nodes (reported by @banane9, issue #1096, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed multiply string node having + symbol instead of x (reported by @luxkitty, issue #194, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed import dialog appearing to the side of the user while in desktop mode and the window is not focused (reported by @luxkitty, issue #1929, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed ButtonValueShift ignoring MaxIsExclusive (reported by @mpmxyz, issue #1435, fixed by @probableprime)\n- Fixed OpenGL base texture format not being set correctly on Linux (reported by iamgreaser, @s3rgal, @rcelyte, issue #69 (nice) fixed by @geenz)\n- Fix RootCategoryView not unregistering event listeners when destroyed\n-- This fixes memory/resource leak\n- Fixed \"Sad\" face tracking shape now being detected as \"Angry\" (reported by @shiftyscales, @nordic, @cataena, @felixq., @flamesoulis, Lxw404, @modernballoonie, issue #2343)\n\n- Fixed migrated content using Fresnel Unlit not appearing as expected (reported by @kulza, issue #40, fixed by @geenz)\n- Fixed PBS_ColorMask not applying EmissiveMap to EmissiveColor channels (reported by @towneh, issue #158, fixed by @geenz)\n- Fixed Reflection material being broken with normal maps (reported by @maksim789456, issue #174, fixed by @geenz)\n- Fixed Matcap materials breaking with normals maps (reported by @luxkitty, issue #200, fixed by @geenz)\n- Fixed NormalScale not affecting fresnel material (reported by @luxkitty, issue #1117, fixed by @geenz)\n- Fixed FresnelLerp material not working when PolarUV's are enabled (reported by @art0007i, issue #1581, fixed by @geenz)\n\n[h2]Obsolete:[/h2]\n- Obsoleted SessionsOrbsController\n-- This will eventually be removed completely, with more generic replacements made using the new WorldsDataFeed\n-- If there are generic things needed to build replacements or missing, let us know (make feature requests)\n- Obsoleted WorldListManager\n-- Note that this will still exist at least until some time after WorldsDataFeed gets ability to also list Records (search published worlds), which would bring it to full feature parity\n-- We are marking this as obsolete now to indicate that we have plans to remove it eventually\n-- If you are building content that needs only opened worlds / sessions, you should use the new WorldsDataFeed and port any existing solutions to this to prepare\n\n[h2]Removals:[/h2]\n- Removed DebugSceneHierachyFeed\n",

We were unsure whether to prioritize IK rework or Performance improvement first, as we received messages, comments and anecdotes about both. Our goal was to gather more solid data and let you, the community, be the deciding factor. \n\n[h2]What's the next priority?[/h2]\nBased on the results from the survey, our next major development priority will be [b]SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS![/b]\n\n[h2]Survey Data[/h2]\nThe support for performance was overwhelming. We have received 2579 responses in total.\n\nFor 72 % of users, performance is the hardest thing preventing them from enjoying Resonite, while IK is 12 %.\n\n67 % of responses indicated that improving performance alone would make them play Resonite more, while 11 % would play more with IK being improved alone. \n\nYou can see more of the data on our Wiki here: https://wiki.resonite.com/May_2024_survey\n\nWe also went over these results in our latest recap stream:\n[previewyoutube=Cg2TgK6wUb0;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[h2]Next Steps[/h2]\nFollowing this, we started organizing performance related issues into a project board on our GitHub here: https://github.com/orgs/Yellow-Dog-Man/projects/29\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list!

We'll keep you updated on the progress on our socials and in the ⁠[url=https://discord.com/channels/1040316820650991766/1154514014563483759]🎥devlog[/url] channel and we'll release any incremental improvements when we can.\n\n[h2]FAQ[/h2]\nAlso to clear some misconceptions, here are some common questions we got:\n[list]\n[*] [b]Does this mean work on IK is cancelled?[/b] - No. It just means we're not doing it right now, but we'll pick it up later\n[*] [b]Will all the work be performance only?[/b] - No. Performance will be our major focus - the biggest task we're currently working on, but we'll still make smaller updates, improvements and additions along the way. \n[*] [b]How will the performance improvements be measured?[/b] - Our primary goal is to increase the overall framerate and reduce stutters and lag spikes as much as possible. Our broad goal is to make Resonite feel better and smoother to use, rather than focus on any specific metric - that said we'll be using a range of tools to profile and benchmark as we work.\n[*] [b]How will performance be optimized? [/b]- We'll determine that based on the research and benchmarking. Currently based on past tests we are most strongly leaning towards switch to process based architecture and use of modern .NET runtime, which has much higher quality codegen, high performance features and much better garbage collector, but this is subject to change. \n[*] [b]Will there be test builds?[/b] - For major changes yes, we'll announce and run public testing.\n[*] [b]Why not just do both at same time?[/b] - Splitting our focus between two major tasks makes both of them take longer as a result. We get things done faster if we focus on one first, then the other.\n[*] [b]Where can I ask more questions?[/b] - Here: [url=https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/discussions/2346]https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/discussions/2346[/url] or at our office hours! \n[/list]\n\n--------------------------\n\nAnyway, that is all for now! I'd like to thank you all for filling out the survey and helping us decide!\n\nFor everyone who would've preferred IK rework first, I know this decision is painful. There's no decision we could've made that would've made everyone happy, but I do hope that the performance improvement will make Resonite more enjoyable as well and make the wait for better IK easier.\n\nAnd to everyone supporting us - thank you! Thanks to your support we remain independent and focused on community. Majority of you even indicates in the survey you'd support us regardless of what next priority we choose, which we appreciated a lot.\n\nWe've got a lot of work ahead of us, but thanks to you, we can continue to grow this platform together!",

      "contents": "Introducing Resonite Package format! You can now export and import any items from Resonite to a standalone package format, which includes everything needed for that item without any reliance on the cloud.\n\nThis can be useful for distributing fully setup Resonite items and avatars outside of Resonite (e.g. on Gumroad or Discord) and making it very easy for users to bring these packages in - just drag & drop them like any other file and they'll import right away. If the avatar is setup with SimpleAvatarProtection, it will be automatically remapped to the importing user too, so the avatars can be setup with full protection from the get go.\n\nThere are two main options for making the package - default and with variants (the +Variants option). Including variants will result in a bigger package, but make the imported item show up much faster - without them user has to calculate the variants on import.\n\nYou can also use this feature for local backups if you want to as well!\n\nThere's a bunch of bugfixes (most of them relating to the export dialog) too. \n\nI hope this feature is useful to you and creators and opens up some cool new options for distributing content on Resonite!\n\n[h2]New Features:[/h2]\n- Implemented `.ResonitePackage` format for exporting items from Resonite to local file and importing back (requested by Narazaka, @akiram_, @jackthefoxotter, ko-tengu, bdunderscore, gameboyjcp, @lill.la, @spexcat, @stellanora, @marsmaantje, @hazre, kisaragiEffective, djsime1, @fuzzyfoxe , issue #950)\n-- You can export any item through the file browser, which will now offer Resonite Package as export format\n-- This format exports/imports the object 1:1 (except the exact asset URL's) to show it is in Resonite without any reliance on the cloud. This includes all necessary assets and components (including ProtoFlux)\n-- This format can be used for distributing items/avatars independently from the cloud, with everything needed in the package\n-- You can also use this format if you want local backups of your items\n-- You can export the package with all variants included - this will make a bigger package, but also the imported object will load much faster. Without the variants the user will have to compute them locally on import, which can take significant amount of time\n-- Note that exporting worlds through world orbs is not supported right now. This can be added if there's interest, but requires more work\n\n- Add OnPackageImported event node (under Flow/Events)\n-- This will fire when the object is imported from a Resonite Package\n-- This lets you do any custom setup and actions when user imports a package\n\n- SimpleAvatarProtection is now Resonite Package aware and will remap itself to the user who imported the package\n-- This lets you setup avatars with full protection on and have this protection be automatically applied to given user\n-- If you don't want this behavior, you can uncheck the new ReassignUserOnPackageImport property\n-- Generally if you want to use this for backup purposes, make sure the not share the package file with anyone. Even if the checkbox is unchecked, the package contains all the raw files, which can be easy to extract for users\n\n[h2]Security:[/h2]\n- Worlds can be started with Unsafe mode on only from dialogs in the Userspace (based on security report by TheAutopilot, ticket #409776, fixed by @probableprime)\n\n[h2]Tweaks:[/h2]\n- Export dialog now updates the extension based on the selected option\n- Improve audio & video exportable strings in the export dialog\n- Picarto.tv is now recognized as video stream when importing (requested by @hafaeith, issue #1543)\n\n[h2]Locale:[/h2]\n- Merged Korean locale update by @mirpasec\n- Merged French locale update by @j4.lc \n- Merged Chinese locale update by modimobeikete\n- Merged German locale update by @muppeq \n- Merged Finnish locale update by @airride91 \n- Merged Japanese locale update by @.aesc\n- Merged Russian locale update by @shadowpanther\n\n[h2]Bugfixes:[/h2]\n- Fix exporting items by grabbing and holding them exporting empty objects\n-- If there are multiple exportables of the same type within the object, they will not be offered to export - make sure to only grab a single item\n-- If you grab multiple separate items, export option won't be offered - make sure to only grab one item\n- Fix asset variants not being found in some cases due to the base URL including an extension\n- Fix export dialog UI generating duplicated options when there are multiple exportables\n- Fixed crash when using ValueConstantLerp and supplying any input with NaN (based on security report by @chameleono2, ticket #734466, fixed by @probableprime)\n-- ValueConstantLerp now propagates NaN to the output when any input is supplied with NaN values. However it will resume normal operation once given normal inputs again\n",
